            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THat I do inſcribe theſe my ſummary <hi>Collections</hi> of ſome few of the <hi>Exorbitancies,</hi> and of the <hi>arbitrary, illegal</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Practices</hi> of the late <hi>unhappy Reigns,</hi> to your <hi>Name;</hi> will, as I hope, be forgiven; when you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon your own dear bought ſhare, in the <hi>melancholy</hi> and
<hi>tragical Tranſactions,</hi> upon which I have ſpent my thoughts.</p>
            <p>The Names of the late <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Shaftesbury;</hi> &amp; of my <hi>Lord Ruſſel</hi> &amp; <hi>Col. Sidney</hi> and other great Men (who were run upon, and deſtroyed by<pb facs="tcp:59848:3"/>a Race of Men, who were raiſed to the <hi>Bench,</hi> from being the <hi>Scandal</hi> of the
<hi>Bar;</hi> and by <hi>ignorant, corrupt</hi> and <hi>partial Jury-Men</hi>) will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred with eternal honour. And by conſequence it muſt be yours, that you were my <hi>Lord Ruſſel's</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared Friend; That you ſerved as <hi>Foreman</hi> of that great <hi>Jury</hi> which guarded the
<hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s Life, and that you expreſſed your ſelf with ſome tranſport of Joy, at the hopes of the brave <hi>Colonel Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>'s deliverance; and that the <hi>ſham Proteſtant Plot</hi> was confounded.</p>
            <p>That from hence immediately your late Troubles ſprung, is freſh in every Bodies remembrance; but 'tis not ſo well known, that you had the guilt of Original Sin upon you; you were a <hi>Barnardiſton,</hi> deſcended of a <hi>Family</hi> well known, and highly eſteemed in
<hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> for many hundreds of years paſt, &amp; which no <hi>Hiſtory</hi> remembers to have<pb facs="tcp:59848:3"/>been
<hi>clouded,</hi> but in times, when the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have ſuffered an <hi>Eclipſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your never to be forgotten Father <hi>Sr Nathaniel Barnardiſton,</hi> was in the worſt of times (<hi>thoſe in which we have lived, excepted</hi>) a <hi>Champion,</hi> &amp; a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>Aſſertor</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Liberties;</hi> He, in the year
1626, when King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, in a moſt arbitrary way,
<hi>required money</hi> by way of <hi>Loan;</hi> (<hi>with many other good</hi> Patriots) refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſubſcribe and lend; and was thereupon, as a
<hi>refractory Perſon (as was the Language of the</hi> Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>of that day</hi>) confined (<hi>far enough from home</hi>) in the County of
<hi>Suſſex;</hi> however, he ſtiffly adhered to his honeſt reſolution againſt that arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary attempt; and continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confinement, till the beginning of the year 1628, when that <hi>King's</hi> ſtraits neceſſitating a <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> impriſoned for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Loane-Money,</hi> were then<pb facs="tcp:59848:4"/>
               <hi>releaſed, and generally throughout the</hi> Kingdom, <hi>elected to preſent the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and aſſert the</hi> Liberties <hi>of the</hi> People, <hi>in that Parliament;</hi> as was Sr <hi>Nathaniel Barnardiſton,</hi> for his
<hi>County</hi> of <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir! The Remembrance of this, when you were firſt invited by that <hi>County,</hi> to repreſent them in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> upon the death of Sr <hi>Henry North,</hi> might in (all propability) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a great
<hi>Miniſter of State</hi> to ſay, <hi>that there was reaſon of State, why you muſt not be</hi> Knight <hi>of your</hi> Shire; and therefore he would appoint an eaſie <hi>Gentleman</hi> (whom he could manage)
<hi>Sheriff,</hi> to keep you out; and ſo he did as long as he could; at a time, when that <hi>Parliament</hi> was corrupted, to ſuch a degree, that the Fate of the <hi>Nation</hi> ſeemed almoſt to depend upon the <hi>Vote</hi> of one or two good <hi>Members;</hi> your <hi>Country,</hi> had upon that occaſion, a manifeſt demonſtration of your Fidelity and<pb facs="tcp:59848:4"/>Zeal, in their Service; you did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily aſſert the right of that
<hi>Election</hi> (than which there never was any more clearly made) &amp; after a tedious and very expenſive attendance, in proſecuting your Complaint of that abuſe; your <hi>Election</hi> was affirmed in the
<hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons;</hi> tho' oppoſed by the united power, of
<hi>Tories, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners</hi> and <hi>Papiſts;</hi> you then came into
<hi>Parliament</hi> at a moſt Critical Juncture, When the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> were eminently beſet, and dangerouſly threatned; you did moſt faithfully and unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly labour there for ſome years, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt very great Diſcouragements; It being in that day a mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, if the true <hi>Engliſh Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of that
<hi>Houſe,</hi> could, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> carry a
<hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> by five or ſix <hi>Voices,</hi> againſt the numerous
<hi>Penſioners,</hi> who were there <hi>liſted; and fed, and paid,</hi> to betray their <hi>Countries</hi> Liberties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59848:5"/>Your demeanour and great deſert in that day of
<hi>England</hi>'s Diſtreſs, merited a Title to the Hearts of your
<hi>Country-Men;</hi> who with very little oppoſition, if not with an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Voice, Elected you, for one of their <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> to the three ſucceeding <hi>Parliaments;</hi> in which, your avowed Oppoſition to <hi>Popery,</hi> and undaunted <hi>Adheſion</hi> to the <hi>Bill of Excluſion;</hi> as the only expedient for ſecuring the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> markt you out to the <hi>Popiſh Rage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe (<hi>Sir.</hi>) were in truth your heinous actual tranſgreſſions; Theſe provoked <hi>Jefferies</hi> (<hi>whoſe Talent lay in facing all things down with Noiſe and Impudence</hi>) to diſcharge a load of Slime and Choler at you; your <hi>Crimes</hi> were complicated; and they lie under a very great miſtake, who think, that your
<hi>Impriſonment</hi> and <hi>Fine</hi> of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> were only for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a Friend, what you believed, and all good Men paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59848:5"/>Having thus mentioned your great Oppreſſion, I ſhall take leave (not for your own, but) for the <hi>Reader's</hi> Information, to inſert the <hi>Reaſons</hi> upon which the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> did lately reverſe, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and wicked
<hi>Judgment</hi> upon you.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The <hi>Information</hi> in this <hi>Caſe,</hi> being grounded upon <hi>Letters,</hi> which in themſelves were not material, but made ſo by <hi>Innuendo's,</hi> their <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> declared, that <hi>Innuendo's,</hi> or ſuppoſed or forced Conſtructions, ought not to be allowed; for all <hi>Accuſations ſhould be plain, and the Crimes aſcertained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. That the <hi>Fine</hi> of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> is exorbitant and exceſſive; not warranted by legal <hi>Precedent</hi> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages; for all Fines ought to be with a <hi>Salvo Contenemento;</hi> and not to the Parties Ruin.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Sir! to detain you no longer upon a ſubject ſo well known, as is that of your own Sufferings and Deſert, I know not whether I ought to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize, for my frequent uſing the name of <hi>Tory;</hi> I am conſcious, that <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Diſcrimination</hi> and
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi> are offenſive to the Ears of good Men; therefore to explain my ſelf; I intend not thereby to expoſe the well-deſerving and pious <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> but I mean the
<hi>Men,</hi> who, (being forſaken of common Senſe and Honeſty) ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ready to renounce the name of <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> and <hi>gloried in Ranting, Damning, Swearing Loyalty;</hi> The <hi>Men,</hi> who encouraged and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the <hi>Murders</hi> of late committed amongſt us; and who, to this hour, go on to palliat and excuſe, if not<pb facs="tcp:59848:6"/>to juſtifie them; The <hi>Men,</hi> who <hi>cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up a</hi> Popiſh <hi>Succeſſor, as the only means to preſerve the</hi> Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and who are now for calling him back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were Men, who would have finiſhed the Ruin of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of its antient and well Eſtabliſhed <hi>Government;</hi> and in the Blood of its beſt

            <p>In ſome caſes a Man ought not to be over-patient; and it muſt move any one, to hear a Learned Lawyer at the Bar, at the time when
<hi>Popery</hi> had actually aſcended the <hi>Throne,</hi> in this manner, to careſs a <hi>Tory-Jury;</hi> Gentlemen! <hi>I cannot but with much Sorrow remember to you, and I know you all remember it too well, that there was a time when the</hi> City of London, <hi>was ſo far corrupted, that it was become a</hi> Refuge <hi>and</hi> Sanctuary <hi>for high</hi> Treaſon; <hi>when there was no Juſtice to be had for the</hi> King <hi>there; when Men lodged themſelves within,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59848:7"/>
               <hi>thoſe Walls, as a Protection for their</hi> Conſpiracies; <hi>We all remember the time, when</hi> Indictments
<hi>were perfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and a plain Evidence given to a</hi> Grand-Jury; <hi>even to the publick ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all that heard it; and yet they have refuſed to find the</hi> Bill; <hi>and not only ſo, but were ſo abetted by the</hi> Rabble; <hi>that it was ſcarce ſafe for the</hi> Judges <hi>to ſit upon the</hi> Bench; <hi>Theſe are things none of us can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, but muſt be perpetually remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; to the ſhame of the</hi> Authors and Contrivers, <hi>of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And muſt it not provoke a Man, to hear the following
<hi>Doctrine</hi> from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> upon the ſad occaſion of the good <hi>Lord Ruſſell's</hi> death (of whom one of the beſt
<hi>Divines</hi> now living, did truely ſay, that an Age would not repaire that loſs to the Nation) viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cuting of Throats would have been counted only a</hi> Scotch
<hi>way of Triming, and the deſtruction of</hi> Princes, <hi>to be<pb facs="tcp:59848:8"/>no more but a perfecting the</hi> Hiſtory <hi>of the</hi> Reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They who cannot riſe up to all the heights of</hi> Conformity; <hi>can yet ſtrain a point upon occaſion, and riſe up to all the heights of</hi> Rebellion <hi>and</hi> Barbarity; <hi>and had not</hi> God
<hi>marvelouſly interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; theſe ſqueamiſh</hi> Conſcience Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>would have ſhewed the truth of this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not aſtoniſhing (at this day, when the
<hi>Parliament</hi> hath declared, that my <hi>Lord Ruſſell, Colonel Sidney</hi> and <hi>Sr Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> were murdered) to heare an Iriſh <hi>Arch-Deacon</hi> (<hi>who fled hither upon the ſcore of Religion, and is a Principal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager of our Charity, to the Iriſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>) publickly ridicule, the death of the firſt two; (<hi>by telling us in an upbraiding way, theſe are your Martyrs</hi>) and affirm, that the laſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed juſtly and according to Law?

               <hi>Repentance,</hi> theſe <hi>extravagancies</hi> undoubtedly, ought to be put into utter
<hi>Oblivion;</hi> now, that <hi>Heaven</hi> has wrought for us, a moſt ſignal and miraculous deliverance; but, which is to be lamented, thoſe very Men, who carryed us to the very brinck of <hi>deſtruction;</hi> are not onely remorſeleſs, but many of them do make it their buſineſs, (by

An <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> was made to forbid our talking of it, under moſt ſevere Penalties: Then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Act</hi> put the
<hi>Sword</hi> into his Hands, by Veſting the <hi>Militia</hi> ſolely in him: The <hi>Pulpits</hi> of the Kingdom (<hi>generally ſpeaking</hi>) were filled with <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who had imbibed the Doctrine of <hi>paſſive Obedience, and Non-Reſiſtance;</hi> An <hi>Oath</hi> was impoſed,

This the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they did that the famous City of <hi>London,</hi> was the chief, if not the only obſtacle to their Helliſh deſign, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was taken to deſtroy it, which they effectually accompliſhed; diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this horrid Villany being made, (not to mention anything of the worthy Sr

            <p>The whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> bring alarmed and put into a ſerment by this accurſed Enterprize, the Plot was poſt-poned; however it was kept alive, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied <hi>Conſpirators</hi> carried it on, and in the Year 1678 the blow was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be given; but then, by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the
<hi>Almighty</hi> Dr <hi>Otes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected their Machinations; He gave his firſt Information thereof to that worthy and never to be forgotten Juſtice of the Peace, Sr <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> of which<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59848:13"/>the
<hi>Conſpirators</hi> having notice, for the ſtifling ſo fatal a diſcovery, they, in a moſt barbarous manner, hurried him out of the World, and did, with effron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Impudence attempt to perſwade the World to believe, that that Gentleman was <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> but Heaven bringing that matter to light, and his Murderers to juſtice; The Plot (maugre all oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſcouragements) began to be ſearched into, and was made out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond contradiction, by ſome looſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Papers found in the Houſe of
<hi>Colman</hi> (the Duke of <hi>York's</hi> Secretary) who had early notice of the diſcovery, and thereupon had carried his moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial (and as it may be reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded he thought all) Papers which might endanger him, or his Maſter's Cauſe, to the Chamber of Mr <hi>Wright</hi> a Profligate Lawyer of <hi>Lincoln's-Inn,</hi> where they were burnt, for which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and good ſervice, <hi>Wright</hi> was afterwards preferred to ſit by turns in every of the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and at length to the place of Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> then whom a Perſon more ſcandalous and ignorant, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in any Age placed there.</p>

            <p>In the firſt place Mr <hi>Foſter,</hi> one of
<hi>Ireland's</hi> Jury, ſwore what the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant evidenced at that Tryal, (<hi>viz.</hi>) his being at the <hi>White-Horſe</hi> Conſult the
24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1678.</p>
            <p>Then the King's Counſel produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59848:19"/>twenty <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Students</hi> of St <hi>Omers,</hi> theſe all teſtified that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant came to St <hi>Omers</hi> in
<hi>December,</hi> 1677. and went not from thence until <hi>June,</hi>
1678.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever reads this Tryal, cannot but obſerve ſome things worthy noting, as</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The rage of the <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> and extraordinary zeal of the <hi>King's Counſel,</hi> both againſt the Defendant, and the belief of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> (of which more in its due place.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Careſſes and tender uſage of theſe Jeſuited Sparks, both by the Court and Counſel; their Evidence was received without the leaſt Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not one croſs, thwarting, or doubting queſtion being put to any one of them, nay, there did not appear ſo much temper as to permit the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to propoſe his queſtions to them, which made him with undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage cry out, That his defence was under a very great prejudice, and that there was a turn to be ſerved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was not admitted to ask the Witneſſes queſtions; And ſaid, I do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe, <hi>That at this rate, it is more</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59848:20"/>
               <hi>ſafe for</hi> Papiſts <hi>to be Traytors, than for any</hi> Proteſtant <hi>to diſcover a Popiſh Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The harmony and uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Evidence, which was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, that any indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt judge, that they were inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Tutors before they came from St
<hi>Omers,</hi> and had oft conn'd their Leſſons by the way, for they did to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration agree in ſwearing to particular days, and to moſt minute and trivial things, as to the day of playing at Nine-Pins, of a Ball being ſtroke over a Wall, and the like.</p>
            <p>In the next place, to inſinuate that the Defendants Evidence was not always true and credited; the <hi>King's Counſel</hi> produced the
<hi>Earl of Caſtlemain,</hi> and <hi>Sr George Wakeman, who decreed that what he ſwore against them at their Tryals was falſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> obſerving the Defendants undauntedneſs, ſaid, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee any one that has the face of a Man, carry it at this rate, when he hears ſuch Evidence brought againſt him; To which the Defendant reply'd, (very well) I wonder Mr <hi>Atturney</hi> will offer to bring this Evidence, <hi>Jefferyes</hi> (<hi>whoſe Character</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59848:20"/>
               <hi>with</hi> King Charles <hi>the ſecond was, that he had the Impudence of ten Carted Whores</hi>) in a raving fit retorted, ſuch Impudence was never ſeen in any Chriſtian Nation, you are a ſhame to Mankind, to which the Defendant's Reply was; No my Lord, I am neither a ſhame to my ſelf, nor to Mankind; what I have ſworn is true, and I will ſeal it with my Blood if occaſion be; <hi>Ah, Ah, my Lord, I know why all this is, and ſo may the World, but this will not do the work to make the</hi> Plot
<hi>to be diſbelieved, things are not to be done by great Noiſes, I will ſtand by the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Defendant in his defence obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Indictment againſt him was ſix years after the pretended Perjury; That the Witneſſes againſt him were ſome of thoſe who gave Evidence at the Tryal of the five <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and tho' there were ſome freſh Witneſſes that they did evidence the ſame thing that was then offered, but the Teſtimony rejected, tho' then, and alſo at <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Tryal, ſixteen St <hi>Omer's</hi> youths were brought to falſifie his Evidence; He further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved very pertinently, that <hi>Whitebread</hi> and
<hi>Fenwick</hi> were preſent, and heard the whole of the Evidence given by him<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59848:21"/>upon the Tryal of <hi>Ireland;</hi> that they were Tryed ſix Months after, and in that time might have provided Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to falſifie his Evidence, they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it was.</p>
            <p>He urged that his Caſe was hard, his Teſtimony having been received with credit, <hi>And the Jury upon convicting the Jeſuites, being told by the Court, That they had found an unexceptionable Verdict, That all the Objections againſt the Evidence were then fully anſwered, that there was nothing that the Priſoners had been wanting in, to object, which could be objected, and that the thing was as clear as the Sun;</hi> And that yet after ſix years he muſt be called to an account for Perjury in that Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of part of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> with which the King and Kingdom, four ſucceſſive Parliaments, all the Judges of the Land, and three Juries were ſo well ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>He further obſerved the ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to baffle his Teſtimony, (<hi>viz</hi>) the Murther of Sr <hi>Edmundberry Godfrey,</hi> who took his firſt Depoſitions, and the contrivance of <hi>Payne, Farewell</hi> and <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> to make Sr <hi>Edmund Felo de ſe.</hi> Then he produced theſe Witneſſes, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59848:21"/>
               <hi>Cicilia Mayo,</hi> who ſwore that ſhe ſaw <hi>Dr Otes,</hi> at <hi>Sr Richard Barker</hi>'s Houſe in
<hi>Barbican,</hi> the latter end of <hi>April</hi> or the beginning of
<hi>May</hi> 1678, and that he came again thither within a few days, and was frequently there; That ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the time by a particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance (<hi>viz.</hi>) her Maſter Sr <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s being ſick all the Month of <hi>April.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All imaginable art was employed by the Chief Juſtice, and the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to perplex and confound this, and all other the Witneſſes for the Defendant, by impertinent and puzling croſs que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; but ſhe honeſtly and very bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtood to it, telling <hi>Jefferies,</hi> that her Evidence was the Truth, and nothing but the Truth; to which he in a ſcoffing taunting way replyed, <hi>Ay, no doubt of it, thou ſweareſt nothing but the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She further added, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant came in a diſguiſe, in a white Hat and coloured Clothes, and went to Sr <hi>Richard's</hi> Ladies Siſter, <hi>Madam Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi> (now in <hi>Wales</hi>) who ſaid to him, Mr
<hi>Otes,</hi> I hear you are turned <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and We can have no Society with you now. That a Servant of Sr <hi>Richard</hi>'s, one
<hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamine</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59848:22"/>
               <hi>Turbet</hi> (ſince dead) law him at thoſe times, and told her that he was turn'd <hi>Jeſuite.</hi> That he Dyned with <hi>Dr Cocket</hi> and <hi>Madam Thorold</hi> (both now in
<hi>Wales</hi>) and with her two Sons (ſince dead) and two Daughters (now in
<hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire</hi>) at Sr <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Houſe three or four days after his firſt coming to the Houſe in the latter end of
<hi>April.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Butler,</hi> Servant to <hi>Sr Richard,</hi> witneſſed that <hi>Dr Otes</hi> came to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in diſguiſe, in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> before the Plot broke out; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Jefferies</hi> demanded how he could be able to ſwear to the preciſe time, and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with repeated queſtions; &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of reaſons for his remembring the month, (tho, by the way no ſuch queſtion was put to any one of the twenty <hi>St Omers</hi> Witneſſes) to which <hi>Butler</hi> anſwered, that he was called to witneſs it about ſix or ſeven Months afterwards, at <hi>Ireland's</hi> Tryal; that he remembred the time by the token that in <hi>May Sr Richard</hi> was ſick at <hi>Putney,</hi> whether he went the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>April,</hi> and ſtayed a fortnight.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Solicitor General</hi> endeavoured to confound this Witneſs with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Queſtions very little to the<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59848:22"/>purpoſe; and <hi>Jeffryes</hi> (with little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) called his Evidence a wild Story without Reaſon. Upon which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ſaid, Truly, my Lord, I do not find you were ſo ſtrict in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the St <hi>Omers</hi> Witneſſes, or bore half ſo hard upon them as you do upon my Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Mrs <hi>Mayo</hi> being again and again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated and thwarted with apparent deſign to confound her, did declare that ſhe did ſee Dr
<hi>Otes</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1678. and that ſhe ſpoke nothing there but as in the preſence of the Lord: Upon which <hi>Jeffryes</hi> ſaid, <hi>We are all of us in the preſence of the Lord always;</hi> and ſhe retorted, And ſhall anſwer before him for all that we have done and ſaid, all of us, the proudeſt and the greateſt here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip Page</hi> ſwore that he could not remember the preciſe time, but that Dr. <hi>Otes</hi> came to Sr <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s in a diſguiſe, when Sr <hi>Richard</hi> was ſick at <hi>Putney</hi> (whereupon the Defendant did well obſerve that the St <hi>Omers</hi> men did ſwear through-ſtitch, but that his honeſt Witneſſes were cautious, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long ago.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59848:23"/>Mr <hi>W. Walter</hi> a Miniſter, ſwore that he met Mr <hi>Otes</hi> between St <hi>Martins</hi> Lane and
<hi>Leiceſter-Fields</hi> in a ſtrange diſguiſe, and that he did then obſerve the Elm-Trees in <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Fields budded forth as big as Hazel-Nuts, ſo that by that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken he reckoned it was between
<hi>Lady-day,</hi> and the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and that it was near a Year and a Quarter before the time when he was examined about this matter at the Tryal of the five Jeſuits, which was the 13th of <hi>June,</hi> 1679.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Attorney-General</hi> called theſe Canting Witneſſes that beat about the Buſh, and ſpoke of Uncertainties.</p>
            <p>Then the Defendant proceeded in his defence, and offered theſe Objections to the Validity of the Evidence brought againſt him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That a</hi> Papiſt <hi>in a Cauſe of Religion is not to be received and believed as a good Witneſs;</hi> (and this caſe did ſurely require Witneſſes above all poſſible Objections againſt their Teſtimony.) But.</p>
            <p>Here Judge <hi>Wythens</hi> interpoſed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Is not a</hi> Papiſt <hi>as good a Witneſs as a Diſſenter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which was anſwer'd by citing <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrode's</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59848:23"/>Reports, part 2. 155. <hi>viz. A Popiſh Recuſant is not to be admitted a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between party and party;</hi> which was alſo my Lord <hi>Cok's</hi> opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wythens</hi> replyed, May a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> be a good Witneſs, Mr <hi>Otes?</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi> (who had help'd the Blood-hounds to murder <hi>Stephen Colledge</hi>) ſaid, Or would Mr
<hi>Colledge</hi> have been a good Witneſs, Mr <hi>Otes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſt certainly by the rules of Law, the Teſtimonies of theſe Perſons ought not to have been offered in this Caſe to delude the People. And it may be well obſerved here, as it was lately in relation to the</hi> Popiſh <hi>Witneſſes about the Birth of the pretended</hi> Prince <hi>of</hi> Wales; <hi>That the Civil Law ſo fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs with our Common Law in rejecting Enemies to be Witneſſes in the Cauſe of their Enemy, that it denyes credit to what they may teſtifie in the cauſe of their Enemy with their dying Breath after they have received the</hi> Enchariſt. <hi>That is the general Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Doctors of the Civil Law,</hi> Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus etiamſi in Articulo mortis conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp; accipiſſet Enchariſtiam repellitur a Teſtimonio Cauſae ſui Inimici.</p>

<hi>Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fryes</hi> in a reproachful manner retorted, No, they are all of them no doubt of it, very good People; Good-Wife <hi>Mayo</hi> and her Companions, excellent <hi>Proteſtants</hi> without all queſtion.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="5">Object. 5. <hi>What was ſaid and done in the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury's <hi>Caſe at the Seſſions in the</hi> Old-Bayly <hi>and</hi> Hickes-Hall. It was there moved for Liberty to bring Indictments of Perjury againſt the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes who accuſed him of Treaſon, but thoſe Motions were over-ruled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not have the King's Witneſſes indicted of Perjury, nor the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot called in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Theſe Objections receiving no other anſwer from the Bench, then that all was trifling and idle; and being ſo huff'd off, the Defendant proceeded to ſpeak to this effect,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord, this I ſay, The Evidence upon which I am indicted, is the ſame which was delivered ſix Years ago at</hi> Whitebread<hi>'s and</hi> Langhorn<hi>'s Tryals, where were ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Witneſſes againſt me, but what credit did they then receive? Now if my Evidence was then to be believed, though oppoſed by ſo many Witneſſes, what new objestion doth riſe againſt it, which was not then hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and anſwered—I do avow the</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59848:25"/>
               <hi>Truth of the</hi> Popiſh <hi>Plot, and will stand by it whilſt I live—I have called ſome Noble Lords to teſtifie for me, but I find either the diſtance of time has wrought upon their Memories, or the difference of the Seaſon has changed their Opinion—Was ever Man dealt with as I am, or had ſuch Evidence offered against him? Who are the Witneſſes to prove this Perjury, but Youths out of a Seminary? My Lord of</hi> Caſtlemaine <hi>and Sr</hi> George Wakeman,
<hi>known</hi> Papiſts? <hi>As for</hi> Caſtlemaine, <hi>all the World knows he was acquitted, becauſe there was but one Witneſs against him, and that without any reflection by the Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> Scrogs <hi>upon my Teſtimony. Then</hi> Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>ſwears all I ſaid against him was falſe, whereas had it not been for two diſhoneſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, one of them</hi> (<hi>meaning</hi> Graham) <hi>I have now in my ſight, we could have proved</hi> 5000 l. <hi>of the Money paid to him, and that he gave a Receipt for it. But my Lord this I am ſure of, if I had been a VVitneſs againſt thoſe who ſuffered in the late Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Plot (as 'twas called) I had never been called in queſtion, if my Evidence had been falſe; but 'tis apparent the</hi> Papiſts <hi>have now a turn to ſerve, and theſe St</hi> Omers
<hi>Youths are brought to falſify my Evidence,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59848:25"/>
               <hi>and to bring off the Lords who ſtand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached of high Treaſon for the Popiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy—My Lord, 'tis not me they indict, but the whole</hi> proteſtant <hi>Intereſt is aimed at in this Proſecution—For my own part I care not what becomes of me, the Truth will one time or another appear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr <hi>Solicitor</hi> in a long Harangue gave great Reputation to the St <hi>Omers</hi> Witneſſes, and then told the Jury, that the Defendants Witneſſes were theſe four, <hi>Cicely Mayo, Butler, Page</hi> and <hi>Walter,</hi> the Parſon; and that he would firſt mention
<hi>Page</hi> and <hi>Walter,</hi> and ſet them out of the way<hi>: Page</hi> (ſays he) remembers to have ſeen <hi>Otes</hi> in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe at Sr
<hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s, but he is not certain as to the time; and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take upon him to ſay what time of the Year, or what Year it was, only he believes it was in <hi>May;</hi> and therefore that can be no ſufficient evidence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Witneſſes, that with great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity ſpeak to certain times. As for <hi>Walter</hi> he cannot remember the time when, neither<hi>:</hi> Nay, the remembrance he has of it goes rather to another time, then the time in queſtion, for being ask'd what circumſtance he knew the<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59848:26"/>time by, he ſaid it was about a year and a quarter before the Plot was diſcovered, which muſt be in <hi>April</hi> or
<hi>May</hi> 1677, and that will do the Doctor no ſervice at all upon this queſtion; thus Mr <hi>Solicitor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For tryal of this learned <hi>Gentleman's</hi> Sincerity, I ſhall review the Evidence given by theſe two Perſons, that the Reader may make his Judgment how fairly they were ſet out of the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> did indeed declare, that he could not be poſitive to the Year or Month, but that to the beſt of his remembrance 'twas in the Year 1678, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>May</hi> (this was like an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt conſcientious Witneſs) but what he further teſtified, did evidently ſhew the time to be in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 1678. For beſides his mentioning the Doctors coming in diſguiſe, according to the evidence of Mrs
<hi>Mayo</hi> and <hi>Butler</hi> he declared that it was at the time when Sr
<hi>Richard Barker</hi> was ill at <hi>Putney,</hi> and that Sr
<hi>Richard</hi> came to Town ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Mrs <hi>Mayo</hi> and
<hi>Butler</hi> ſwore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly that the time of the Doctors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in diſguiſe, was when Sr <hi>Richard</hi> was ſick at <hi>Putney,</hi> and that that was in the end of <hi>April</hi> or beginning of <hi>May</hi>
1678.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:59848:26"/>As to Mr <hi>Walter,</hi> his evidence was, that he met the <hi>Doctor</hi> in diſguiſe, and did upon that very day obſerve the Elm Trees budded forth, ſo that by that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken he thought it might be between <hi>Lady-day</hi> and the latter end of <hi>April;</hi> and as to the Year, that it was near a Year and Quarter, before he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined about this matter, at the Tryal of the five <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> which was the 13th of
<hi>June,</hi> 1679; but Mr <hi>Solicitor</hi> (<hi>to the end this Man's Teſtimony might not ſerve the Doctor, as he himſelf worded it</hi>) repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it quite otherwiſe, and tells the <hi>Jury,</hi> that Mr
<hi>Walter</hi> ſaid, the time was about a year and a quarter before the
<hi>Plot</hi> was diſcovered, and ſo makes the time to be <hi>April</hi> or
<hi>May</hi> 1677, though Mr <hi>Walter,</hi> in ſpeaking for himſelf, being ask'd about the time of the diſcovery of the Plot, ſaid, that he could not tell when the Plot was diſcovered, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be found out yet or no. <hi>Where is the Candor or Ingenuity of this proceeding?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now comes the Scandal of the Law, <hi>Jeffryes, that mortal Enemy to the Liberties of England,</hi> and all true <hi>Engliſh-men;</hi> He foaming, vomits a flood of Malice and Rage; Firſt, <hi>he careſſes Sr</hi> William<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59848:27"/>Dodſon <hi>and his Brethren of the Jury, with the complement, that to his knowledge they are Perſons of great underſtanding and abilities;</hi> and adds, that Mr <hi>Solicitor</hi> had ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Labour, by the pains he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to ſum up the Evidence to them, <hi>which he concluded he had without doubt done, with all faithfulneſs to his Maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then proceeds to blacken the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant with all the foul Language that Malice could ſuggeſt, and tells his old Friends of the
<hi>Jury, (whoſe acquaintance with him diſpoſed them to credit him) that the</hi> Popiſh <hi>Plot was a ſham, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence thereof, another black and bloody Conſpiracy was carried on:</hi> Then he magnifies the evidence againſt the Defendant, both from the number of the St <hi>Omers Sparks,</hi> no leſs then twenty, but alſo their harmony: and he affirms, that againſt the credit of their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, there was no objection really made, but only Impudence; that the Defendant had produced but two poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Witneſſes, &amp; that they were likewiſe poſitive in their contradiction of one another; that they ſwore according as their humour led them, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any remembrance they had of<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59848:27"/>the thing; and that he rather believed it, becauſe the third Witneſs,
<hi>Page,</hi> gave an evidence contrary to both of them, (<hi>how notoriouſly falſe theſe mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Suggeſtions are, will evidently appear upon the peruſal of what theſe three honeſt and plain-dealing Witneſſes ſwore.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Then he comes to the Defendants fourth Witneſs, Mr
<hi>Walter;</hi> and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively affirms, that he ſays nothing to the matter, for that it did plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the time which he ſpeaks of, was about a year and a half before the five <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Tryal, which muſt be in 1677, before the Defendant went to St <hi>Omers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Solicitor</hi> told the Jury, that Mr <hi>Walter</hi> ſpoke of a year and a quarter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſcovery of the Plot; had that been true, it had run it back to the year 1677, and to a time before the
<hi>Doctor</hi> went to St <hi>Omers.</hi> His Lordſhip makes Mr
<hi>VValter</hi> to ſpeak of about a year and a half before the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> Tryal, which runs it back to <hi>December</hi> 1677; and then the King's celebrated Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Mr <hi>VValter</hi> are agreed; but Mr <hi>Vvalter, (ſpeaking for himſelf) ſays, the time was near a year and a quarter before</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59848:28"/>
               <hi>the Tryal of the Jeſuits, which brings us to April</hi> 1678.</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Solicitor</hi> were not agreed in this matter, yet they would not quarrel about it, provided the
<hi>underſtanding Jury</hi> would credit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, againſt Mr
<hi>Walter,</hi> and ſo ſerve the turn they aimed at, the baffling the credit of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot; and not allow this Witneſs to be ſerviceable to the Vindication of Dr <hi>Otes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the following day after this Tryal, Dr <hi>Otes</hi> was tryed upon an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment</hi> for another ſuppoſed <hi>Perjury,</hi> but that proſecution being of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion with what is here preſented, I ſhall not trouble the Reader with any thing further upon this ſubject, then to preſent him with the Names of the Jury (viz.)

            <p>THe unlucky miſcarriage of <hi>Reading's</hi> attempt, to corrupt the <hi>King's</hi> Evidence, or to overthrow the credit of their Teſtimony, deterred not others from proſecuting ſo pious a work; for that is inſtantly ſucceeded by the curſed Conſpiracy of <hi>Knox,</hi> and of <hi>Lane,</hi> and <hi>Osborne;</hi> the one lately, the other at

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Indictment</hi> (opened by Mr <hi>Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>) was, that whereas <hi>Colman, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove,</hi> conſpired to deſtroy the <hi>King</hi> and change the <hi>Religion</hi> Eſtabliſhed by Law; &amp; to introduce <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and were thereof Convicted, Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Executed; And whereas the<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59848:33"/>
               <hi>Lord Powis, Lord Arundel</hi> of <hi>VVardour,</hi> and others were accuſed of thoſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Impeached for the ſame in Parliament,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Defendants know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr <hi>Otes</hi> and Mr
<hi>Bedloe</hi> had given In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of theſe Treaſons, to ſtifle the Evidence and ſcandalize them, did conſpire to repreſent them as wicked Perſons, and of no credit. And the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment further ſets forth, that
<hi>Knox,</hi> with the agreement of <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Oſborne,</hi> cauſed Letters to be wrote, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance to accuſe <hi>Otes</hi> and
<hi>Bedloe,</hi> that they had conſpired falſly to accuſe the E. of
<hi>Danby.</hi> And that <hi>Otes</hi> had attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to commit <hi>Sodomy</hi> with <hi>Lane:</hi> that, to effect thoſe wicked deſigns, <hi>Knox</hi> gave ſeveral ſums of Money to <hi>Oſborne</hi> and <hi>Lane,</hi> and had promiſed great Rewards to them.</p>
            <p>Then the Cauſe was opened by that moſt incomparable Perſon (<hi>the honour of the Law</hi>) old <hi>Sr John Maynard,</hi> (<hi>now firſt Lord Commiſſioner of the great Seal,</hi> whoſe Ability, Integrity and Deſert, have kept him from a Seat upon the <hi>Benches of Weſtminſter,</hi> till about the eighty eighth Year of his Age; when Heaven ſet the Law free) he ſpoke to this effect;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59848:34"/>This Cauſe is of great conſequence; there hath been an horrid and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> againſt the
<hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Nation,</hi> our <hi>Religion</hi> and the Law<hi>:</hi> The firſt diſcovery of this <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> came from a ſingle Perſon, who ſtood ſingle and diſcouraged a long time, and there were endeavours to diſcourage his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery, when it ſtood ſo. Sr
<hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> having taken his Examination, then the endeavour was to ſuppreſs it, and that by no leſs a wickedneſs then the barbarous Murder of that honeſt Gentleman; that being accompliſhed, they ſtrived to baffle and defame him when dead. All this while he ſtood ſingle; it fell out, by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, that <hi>Bedloe</hi> made a further diſcovery, and publick Juſtice has gone upon it.</p>
            <p>Then they attempted to corrupt his Teſtimony with Bribes and Rewards, and <hi>Reading,</hi> who tranſacted it, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of it,
<hi>ſcelere tutandum eſt ſcelus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having gone all theſe ways, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to ſee if they can diſgrace and baffle the Evidence of <hi>Otes</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> by ſcandalizing them, with foul offences, eſpecially <hi>Dr Otes;</hi> and that<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59848:34"/>was thus, <hi>Knox</hi> tampered with <hi>Lane,</hi> a Servant to <hi>Otes,</hi> to accuſe him of the Horrid Sin of <hi>Sodomy:</hi> In order to it, there were Letters wrote by <hi>Oſborne,</hi> who is run away, but contrived by <hi>Knox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It happens in this caſe as it did long ago; as the
<hi>Hiſtorian</hi> told us, <hi>multi ob ſtultitiam non put abant, multi ob ignorantiam non videbant, multi ob pravitatem non cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debant et non credendo conjurationem adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vabant.</hi> To this Sr <hi>Creſwell Levens,</hi> the King's Attorney-General added, <hi>This is a counter-part of Mr</hi> Reading<hi>'s Caſe, only it ſeems in this to differ, that it exceeds the Original.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the proceeding upon the cauſe, it was proved that
<hi>Lane,</hi> upon his firſt coming to Dr <hi>Otes</hi> in <hi>November</hi>
1678, had a deſign to accuſe him, as he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward did, of <hi>Sodomy, a Crime above the common ſtandard of Villanies;</hi> That he declared whilſt he was with the <hi>Doctor,</hi> that he hoped in a ſhort time to get 1000
<hi>l.</hi> That <hi>Lane</hi> ſent for <hi>Sr William Waller,</hi> that he might confeſs the whole Contrivance to him, declaring that he was pricked in Conſcience for the falſe Oaths he had taken.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Oſborne</hi> had confeſſed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59848:35"/>before a <hi>Committee</hi> of the Houſe of
<hi>Lords</hi> (and alſo before <hi>Sr William Waller</hi> and <hi>Juſtice Warcup</hi>) that they were ſuborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Knox</hi> to ſwear falſly againſt <hi>Dr Otes</hi> and <hi>Mr Bedloe, and that he had given them money to do it.</hi> That <hi>Knox</hi> made <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborne</hi> ſwear Secrecy, and to ſtand faſt to the Inſtructions he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them. That he went to the <hi>Sugar-Loaf</hi> in <hi>Pickadilly,</hi> and took Lodgings for them, and lay there with them, and promiſed them Money and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and told <hi>Lane</hi> that he need not doubt but the
<hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower</hi> would acknowledge their Kindneſs.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Oſborne</hi> ſaid, they were going from <hi>Dr Otes,</hi> that they were ſworn Brothers, if the one did go, the other would; and they ſhould get Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment and have 100 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and 500 <hi>l.</hi> in Money.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Knox</hi> his endeavours to blaſt the Teſtimony of
<hi>Dr Otes</hi> and <hi>Mr Bedloe,</hi> it was proved, That</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knox</hi> endeavour'd to ſuborn <hi>H. Wiggins</hi> to accuſe Mr <hi>Bedloe,</hi> his Maſter. That he propoſed to
<hi>Thurſton,</hi> a Servant to <hi>Dr Otes,</hi> to be very kind to him, if he could find any thing to Swear againſt<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59848:35"/>his Maſter. That <hi>Knox,</hi> to invite <hi>VVig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> to betray and accuſe Mr
<hi>Bedloe,</hi> ſaid, The King knows <hi>Otes</hi> and <hi>Bedloe</hi> to be great Rogues, and when he has got what he can out of them, he will hang them up. That when <hi>Knox, Lane</hi> and <hi>Oſborne</hi> were Priſoners in the Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, for this contrivance; <hi>Knox</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Keeper</hi> a Reward to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to correſpond by Letters with
<hi>Lane,</hi> and gave him three half Crowns, deſiring him to ſpeak to
<hi>Lane</hi> to ſtand faſt to him, and <hi>then they ſhould be two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one;</hi> for he fear'd <hi>Osborne</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed them about the buſineſs of <hi>Dr Otes;</hi> That <hi>Knox,</hi> and <hi>Lane,</hi> and <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi> went to <hi>Juſtice Dewy,</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi> told him, he was adviſed to come to him to take an Information againſt <hi>Dr Otes;</hi> and that they went to <hi>Juſtice Chey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> upon the ſame errand. That <hi>Lane</hi> had been kept the laſt Summer at the <hi>Lord Powis</hi> his houſe, &amp; had 10<hi>s. per</hi> week allowed him. That
<hi>Knox</hi> was to have 30 or 40 <hi>l.</hi> to carry on the buſineſs, and that <hi>Knox, Osborne</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> were to be rewarded by the
<hi>Lords</hi> in the Tower, for their evidence againſt <hi>Dr Otes</hi> and
<hi>Mr Bedloe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59848:36"/>That <hi>Lane</hi> being taken, <hi>Knox</hi> ſent for <hi>Oſborne,</hi> and carried him in a Coach to <hi>White Fryers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Papers relating to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy</hi> were delivered by <hi>Knox</hi> to <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> and went about to the
<hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Nevil</hi> alias
<hi>Paine,</hi> and were by him amended, and then delivered to <hi>Knox</hi> again.</p>
            <p>The Caſe appearing ſo very clear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Evidence, the
<hi>Jury</hi> without going from the Bar found the Defendants guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whereupon they received this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Sentence; <hi>Knox,</hi> the principal, (<hi>who is now at this day in a better ſtation (at Court) than ever he was in his Life, or could ever have hoped for</hi>) Fined two hundred Marks; to be Impriſoned a year, and to be bound to the good behaviour for three years;

               <hi>Mr Serjeant Maynard</hi> obſerved to the Jury that this practice was not new, and minded them of what <hi>Reading,</hi> and what
<hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> did, and that this was the third Cauſe of that Kind, and it went ſomewhat further then the two former; for this was to be done in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſubſcribed by <hi>Dugdale</hi> to be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59848:38"/>produced upon occaſion, to defame all the Evidence; the Witneſſes being then called, <hi>Dugdale</hi> teſtified that he had been long acquainted with <hi>Mrs Price,</hi> and that before <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Tryal, ſhe deſired him to be kind to <hi>Harcourt,</hi> becauſe he had been her Confeſſor; and <hi>Mr Wright</hi> teſtified that he over-heard her make this requeſt to <hi>Dugdale;</hi> and that <hi>Dugdale,</hi> upon their parting, told him (upon his enquiry what ſhe ſaid to him) that it was to take off his Evidence againſt <hi>Harcourt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dugdale</hi> further teſtified, that ſhe treated with him for to retrct his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and to be gone, and to leave the Paper behind him, to ſignifie the trouble in his mind, for the wrong done in his Teſtimony<hi>: To this he is invited by the promiſe of</hi> 1000 l. <hi>of a Pardon for Body and Soul, and aſſurance of Security abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Dugdale</hi> acquainted my <hi>Lord</hi> of
<hi>Shaftſbury, Mr Hambden</hi> and <hi>Mr Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> with this; who adviſed him to get ſome Perſons to be by, when they further treated about this buſineſs, which he did.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Mrs Price</hi> told him, <hi>that the Duke of</hi> York
<hi>had a wiſe Council,</hi> and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59848:38"/>it ſo, that if he would come over to them, there would not a <hi>Papiſt</hi> more ſuffer; that the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſhould in a ſhort time be hanged,
<note n="*" place="margin">Note this, of Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Witneſſes is the ſame Argument uſed by <hi>Knox</hi> in his tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with
<hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,</hi> and it evinces, that by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Conſpirators, ſome of the Witneſſes were to be corrupted, &amp; thoſe who were temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation proof, to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized and hanged.</note> The <hi>Plot ſhould be turned on the</hi> Proteſtants,
<hi>&amp;</hi> Popery <hi>ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in half a Year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Mrs Price</hi> brought <hi>Mr Tasborough</hi> to him, who told him that all that <hi>Mrs Price</hi> had propoſed &amp; promiſed to him, ſhould be perform'd; that he muſt ſign the Paper; be gone, and give no more evidence; and he ſhould have protection, pardon and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; and
<hi>That</hi> Tasborough <hi>tranſacted all this in the Duke of</hi> York<hi>'s Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr Chamberlain</hi> teſtified, that he was in a Cloſet in
<hi>Dugdale's</hi> Chamber, and that Mrs <hi>Price</hi> came into the Chamber, and he heard their Diſcourſe; and ſhe told him, that the <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſadour</hi> was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to treat with him, becauſe he muſt uſe an <hi>Interpreter,</hi> which would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. That ſhe perſwaded him to be<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59848:39"/>gon, and the <hi>Duke of York</hi> would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him, pardon him, and give him 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and that then
<hi>Dugdale</hi> ſaid to her, You know Mrs <hi>Price</hi> that I began not this Intrigue with you, but you propoſed it to me, which ſhe owned; That upon <hi>Dugdale's</hi> demanding of her how the 1000<hi>l.</hi> ſhould be ſecured; She ſaid ſhe would in a Weeks time bring a Perſon of quality, who ſhould ſecure it to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Cleave,</hi> who was in the Cloſet at the ſame time, teſtified to the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with <hi>Dr Chamberlaine;</hi> and added, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> asked her when he ſhould go to the <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſadour;</hi> and that <hi>Dugdale</hi> told her, he well liked her offer of bringing a perſon of Quality to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and ſhe then ſaid, you ſhall have the <hi>Duke of York</hi>'s Protection, and a Pardon, not only for your Body but your Soul; <hi>a large Proffer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Dugdale</hi> told her, that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over to them, and going away, would ſignifie little, there being <hi>Dr Otes</hi> and others to go on with the Evidence: To which ſhe anſwered, We do not care ſo much for them, for the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Eye is only upon you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59848:39"/>Sr <hi>Robert Southwell,</hi> Sr <hi>John Nicolas,</hi> and Sr <hi>Thomas Doleman,</hi> Clerks of the <hi>Council,</hi> teſtified, that Mrs <hi>Price,</hi> being examined before the
<hi>Council</hi> the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> and being demanded who fram'd the Paper for her, ſet forth in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, ſhe ſaid, that ſhe ſtudied it, and indicted it her ſelf.</p>
            <p>That Mr <hi>Taſborough</hi> being asked about the Paper, ſpoke very cautiouſly; that he did not poſitively ſay he had preſſed
<hi>Dugdale</hi> to ſign it, but told him, unleſs he ſigned it, he could not proceed to get any favour for him, for that was to teſtifie him to be a Penitent.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Croſſe</hi> teſtified, that Mrs <hi>Price</hi> ſpoke to <hi>Dugdale</hi> not to proceed further againſt
<hi>Parſon's</hi> (a <hi>Prieſt</hi> in the Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe) than he had done.</p>
            <p>The guilt of the <hi>Defendants</hi> being thus clearly made out, and nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial offered in their defence; the <hi>Jury</hi> without ſtirring from the Bar, found them both guilty of the Charge in the Indictment.</p>
            <p>It might have been reaſonably expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the reiterated attempts to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born the Witneſſes of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> would have irritated the Juſtice of the<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59848:40"/>
               <hi>Nation,</hi> to more ſeverity upon theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; but 'tis evident that the <hi>Plot</hi> did daily grow and gain ground, even upon our Courts of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here take occaſion to obſerve, what Fines had been formerly impoſed upon <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> for Offences, very ſlight, compared with this; Mr <hi>Joſeph Brown,</hi> in the <hi>Term</hi> before the
<hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> broke out, in 1678. was adjudged to pay 1000 Marks fine; to find Sureties for the good Behaviour for ſeven years, and to have his name ſtruck out of the Roll of Attornies, and what was his Crime? Why, the Superſcribing a Pacquet to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> wherein was only incloſed a very good Book, called the <hi>Long Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament Diſſolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Benjamin Harris</hi> a Book-ſeller, in the year 1680. adjudged to pay 500<hi>l.</hi> Fine, to ſtand in the Pillory, and to be bound to the good Behaviour for three years; (and Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> would have had him Whipt into the bargain, but that Mr Juſtice
<hi>Pemberton</hi> checkt it, by holding up his hands in Admiration) this perſons Crime was, the publiſhing a Book called, <hi>An Appeal from the Country to the City,</hi> in which this paſſage was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59848:40"/>
               <hi>We in the Country have done our parts in chuſing good Members for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but if they muſt be Diſſolved or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued when-ever they come to redreſs the Grievances of the Subject, we may be pittied, not blamed, if the Plot takes effect, as in all probability it will; Our Parliaments are not then to be condemned, for their not being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſit occaſioned it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, when we come to Judgments for Miſdemeaners on the other ſide; We ſhall perceive great Compaſſion and Mercy appearing in that Court; indeed <hi>Reading,</hi> who was Convicted for the firſt attempt upon the <hi>King's-Witneſſes,</hi> was adjudged to pay 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to be Pilloried, and Impriſoned for a year; and one would have thought, that more ſevere Judgments would have paſt upon ſuch as ſhould dare to repeat the ſame Crimes, after ſuch an Example; but we ſee the contrary; About ſix Months afterwards <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> being Convicted of the ſame Offence, accompanied with much blacker Circumſtances, <hi>Knox</hi> the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, was only Fined 200 Marks, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to a years Impriſonment, and to be bound to the good Behaviour for three years<hi>:</hi> And
<hi>Lane</hi> Fined 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Marks,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59848:41"/>and adjudged to ſtand once in the Pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to be Impriſoned a year. And now in the Caſe before us, (Mr
<hi>Taſborough,</hi> a Gentleman of a good Eſtate, who had treated about ſo great a Villany in the name of the <hi>Duke of York</hi>) was only Fined
100 <hi>l.</hi> And Mrs <hi>Price</hi> 200 <hi>l.</hi> But who can admire at this notorious departure from the rules of Juſtice and Equality in the aſſeſſing of Fines, that remembers that the <hi>Chief Juſtice Scroggs, did in this very</hi> Term <hi>declare in open Court, in the Caſe of Dr</hi> Jeſſop, <hi>a very honeſt and worthy Proteſtant of</hi> Norfolk, <hi>that he would have regard to Perſons and their Principles, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Fines; and would ſet a Fine of</hi> 500 <hi>l. on one perſon, for the ſame offence, for which he would not Fine another</hi> 100
<hi>l.</hi> And accordingly Fined Dr <hi>Jeſſop</hi> 100 <hi>l.</hi> for reporting falſe News, as they called it, and at the ſame time Fined the
<hi>Doctor's Author</hi> of that News, (<hi>a right Tory no doubt</hi>) only five Marks; Now ſurely will the Reader ſay, this <hi>Jeſſop</hi> was undoubtedly a very naughty Man; but to undeceive him, I can affirm, he is as true a <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Man as can be found; and the bad principle, which made him to be thus marked, was, that<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59848:41"/>he was an avowed Enemy to <hi>Popery,</hi> and true to the <hi>Liberties of England;</hi> and did, upon every occaſion, exert himſelf, to a degree hardly to be equalled by any Gentleman of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> for the chuſing deſerving men for <hi>Knights</hi> of the ſhire; and particularly for Sr
<hi>John Hobart,</hi> then whom none ever deſerved better of that County, and whoſe name will always be remembred there, with great Honour. For this extravagant Partiality and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in impoſing Fines, the Court of
<hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> was deſervedly marked with this Vote of the Houſe of
<hi>Commons.</hi>

            <p>It is to be obſerved, that this Paper had neither date, nor any Hand to it; nor did it appear of whoſe Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it was; but Sr
<hi>Francis Wythens</hi> ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated the matter, ſaying, That tho' the Paper began very plauſibly, and went a great way ſo, yet in the laſt clauſe but one, they came to perfect levying of War, declaring, that they would joyn to deſtroy the mercenary Forces about <hi>London</hi> (<hi>the words by the way were, to disband the mercenary Forces</hi>

               <hi>raiſed and kept up to advance arbitrary Power;</hi> but ſuch a miſtake may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Sr <hi>F. Wythens,</hi> and alſo to that ſmooth <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice North,</hi> who in ſuming up the Evidence to the Grand
<hi>Jury,</hi> did wilfully (no doubt of it) make the ſame miſ-repreſentation of that matter. Mr <hi>Saunders</hi> added, that the deſign of the Paper was pretended to oppoſe <hi>Popery</hi> and
<hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and deſtroy the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> which ſeemed not ſo much in it ſelf; but that their Witneſſes would ſhew, who thoſe <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> were that were to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are called, who were, <hi>John Booth,</hi> (a moſt notorious and ſcandalous Villain, who had been guilty of ſeveral Felonies); <hi>Edward Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> and <hi>John Smyth,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Prieſt</hi> (who were manifeſtly perjured in the Tryal of honeſt <hi>Colledge</hi>) <hi>Brian Haynes, John Macnamar, Dennis Macnamar, Edward Ivey</hi> and <hi>Bernard Dennis</hi> (<hi>Profligate Iriſh Witneſſes,</hi> who, according to every ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, had traded in
<hi>Swearing and Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing.</hi>)</p>
            <p>It may ſuffice to preſent the Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader with the Names of theſe ſcandalous Fellows; for 'twould be<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59848:47"/>nauſeous to detain him, in reading the non-ſenſical, incredible, contradictory ſtuff, ſworn by them; as, <hi>That the Earl would raiſe the Kingdom, to compel the King to give</hi> Haynes <hi>a Pardon. That the Government was to be changed to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>to be King. That the Earl ſhould tell</hi> Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namar, <hi>and</hi> Ivey, <hi>that he would bring the King's Head to the Block.</hi> That a Perſon of the Earl of
<hi>Shaftesbury</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caution <hi>ſhould talk Treaſon</hi> (or any thing elſe) <hi>with ſo infamous a Fellow as</hi> Haynes, <hi>for an Hour together, in a Cook's Shop in</hi> Ironmonger-Lane.</p>
            <p>It ſeems here worthy of Obſervation, that the
<hi>Conſpirators</hi> clap'd this <hi>Noble Lord</hi> into the
<hi>Tower,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>July</hi> 1681; but the Term coming on, when they muſt proſecute him, or he would be bailed out; they were then to ſeek for <hi>Engliſh Witneſſes</hi> to back the truſty
<hi>Iriſh;</hi> ſo <hi>Booth</hi> and the reſt were rak'd together; and
<hi>Captain Wilkinſon</hi> (<hi>one of the honeſteſt Men, then or now living</hi>) was tempted and threatned, at a more then ordinary rate, to come in, to back and credit their Teſtimony; as was evidently made out by his
<hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:59848:48"/>which, to his eternal honour, he publiſhed before this proſecution; an <hi>Abſtract</hi> whereof, I do hereunto ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, to evince the curſed practiſes of thoſe dayes, and to mind an ungratful Generation, of the merit of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy upright Perſon.</p>
            <p>It may <hi>alſo</hi> deſerve Remark, that the Treaſonable diſcourſes Sworn againſt his Lordſhip by theſe Varlets, were fix'd by them, to <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March</hi> before; the <hi>Inſtructors of theſe Witneſſes</hi> well remembring, that that was a time when the
<hi>Nation</hi> was in no ſmall fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the trifling with
<hi>Parliaments</hi> for the introduceing <hi>Popery</hi> and
<hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> yet moſt of theſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> upon their examination, were forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they gave (<hi>or rather ſold</hi>) their <hi>Informations,</hi> after my <hi>Lord</hi> of
<hi>Shafteſbury</hi> was committed in <hi>July,</hi> upon a <hi>Warrant</hi> for <hi>high Treaſon,</hi> which <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Jenkins</hi> (<hi>who managed this whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue and the Witneſſes thereof</hi>) gloried, that he had the honour to ſign.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here take occaſion to declare, what I have long believed, that the amuſing us in <hi>England,</hi> with the <hi>Iriſh Popiſh Plot,</hi> did proceed from the depth<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59848:48"/>of the
<hi>Jeſuits Counſels,</hi> with deſign to trip up the Heels of their execrable <hi>Plot</hi> here; &amp; that they ſent us theſe wretches on that very errand. I do alſo think that the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> then at
<hi>Whitehall,</hi> did, in the management of this <hi>Intrigue,</hi> over-reach this great and wiſe Lord, the <hi>Earl of Shafteſbury;</hi> and that his zeal to extirpate <hi>Popery</hi> in both the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, diſpoſed him to be too credulous in that matter of the <hi>Iriſh Plot,</hi> at leaſt as to the honeſty of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But, what Man endued with the leaſt grain of Honeſty and Senſe, could ever credit the Evidence againſt this <hi>Noble Peer,</hi> after the reading <hi>Mr Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>'s <hi>Tryal;</hi> and the <hi>Information</hi> of worthy
<hi>Captain Wilkinſon,</hi> about this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affair.</p>
            <p>As to the Paper found in the <hi>Earl's</hi> Houſe, and upon which ſo great ſtreſs was laid, I ſhall here note, that at this time it was notoriouſly known, even in every <hi>Coffee-Houſe, that an Aſſociation</hi> (and very probably this now given in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <hi>had been reſolved upon and read in Parliament;</hi> and the <hi>Fore-man</hi> of the <hi>Grand-Jury,</hi> who was a <hi>Member,</hi> well knowing that the
<hi>Plot-Secretary</hi> was then<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59848:49"/>of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of
<hi>Commons;</hi> examined him ſtrictly about it; but he appeared very reſerved and cautions in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, and could not at firſt remember that he had heard of the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> but as <hi>Town-talk;</hi> but being cloſely followed with Queſtions by the worthy <hi>Fore-man,</hi> he, very unwillingly, went a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, That to the beſt of his remembrance he was not preſent in the <hi>Houſe</hi> at the Reading the
<hi>Aſſociation; though 'tis notoriouſly known that he did there make Speeches againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To evince that the project of an <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation</hi> was no new thing; I cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſelf from a ſmall digreſſion, to ſhew, that one of this formal <hi>Secretary's Confidents, Nathaniel Thompſon,</hi> the <hi>Popiſh Printer,</hi> had publiſhed the news of this
<hi>Aſſociation,</hi> near two Years before this proſecution; it is in his <hi>Intelligence</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> the 9th, 1679, in theſe Words, <hi>A form of an Aſſociation is preparing, for People to ſubſcribe, for the defence of the</hi> King's <hi>ſacred</hi> Perſon,

               <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> The <hi>Priſoner</hi> ſtands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted of
<hi>High Treaſon,</hi> and that of the deepeſt dye; it is for an endeavour to<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59848:58"/>deſtroy the <hi>King,</hi> to ſubvert the
<hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and to raiſe a <hi>Rebellion</hi>—He laid his deſign to ſeize the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and he wanted not his
<hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices</hi> to do it:
<note place="margin">The World never was, nor ever will be obliged with a Liſt of the Accomplices here talked of.</note> But they were not
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> but Men that were <hi>Rebels</hi> in the late War—In order to this, he hath prepared Arms of a great value for a
<hi>Joyner; He prepared a good Horſe, extraordinary Piſtols, a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine a Coat of Mail, an Head-piece, and ſo being arm'd Cap a Pe, with that deſign he came to Oxford—We</hi> ſhall ſhew you, that he made it his buſineſs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade others to undertake the deſign, and joyn with him.—<hi>He</hi> gave out a <hi>Sign</hi> which was a <hi>blew Ribbon</hi> wrought with Letters in it (<hi>No Popery, no Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>) by this they were to know one another—<hi>We</hi> ſhall give you an Account of his <hi>Principles;</hi> and what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement he was to have, for
<hi>he boaſted he ſhould in a little time be a Colonel</hi>—This was not a ſudden unpreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated thing; for he had entertained the horrideſt malice againſt the <hi>King,</hi> that ever <hi>Subject</hi> did, <hi>He</hi> hath made it<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59848:58"/>his common diſcourſe (<hi>I believe I could bring you forty and forty Witneſſes to it</hi>) to defame the
<hi>King,</hi> and murder him in his Reputation—<hi>We</hi> ſhall give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he carried on the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, with that <hi>Arch-Taytor, Fitz. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> who was a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and <hi>I believe if he were examined throughly, he would be found of the ſame Stamp</hi>—The
<hi>King</hi> hath been traduced, as a <hi>deſigner of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government,</hi> and <hi>as an Introducer of Popery—If any Man ever was guilty of high Treaſon ſure he is, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the ſevereſt puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Stephen Dugdale, John Smyth, Bryan Haynes</hi> &amp;
<hi>Edward Turbervile</hi> were ſworn: <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſaid, That the
<hi>Priſoner</hi> had oft rail'd againſt the <hi>King,</hi> &amp;
<hi>ſaid he was a Papiſt,</hi> and as deep in the <hi>Plot</hi> as any
<hi>Papiſt</hi> of them all; <hi>that nothing was to be expected from him, but introducing of Popery and Arbitrary Government;</hi> That he would arm himſelf, and be here at <hi>Oxford,</hi> having ſeveral ſtout Men, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Captain Clinton, Captain Brown,</hi> and <hi>Don Lewis; that would ſtand by him, in caſe there ſhould be a Riſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Priſoner</hi> gave him forty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings worth of
<hi>Blew-Ribbon,</hi> with the<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59848:59"/>
               <hi>Inſcription, No Popery, No Slavery,</hi> to give to his Friends—That the <hi>Priſoner</hi> ſaid at <hi>Oxford, Let the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin as ſoon as he will, his Party is but an handful to our Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Smyth</hi> declared, That the <hi>Priſoner</hi> told him,
<hi>that the</hi> King <hi>was as great a Papiſt as the Duke of</hi> York,
<hi>and every way as dangerous to the Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> and he doubted not but he would dye his Fathers death.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Colledge</hi> carried him to his Houſe, and ſheweth him his <hi>Piſtols, Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuſs, great Sword, Armour Back and Breaſt, and his Head-piece;</hi> and told him theſe would deſtroy <hi>Rowlye's</hi> pittiful Guards, which were kept up againſt Law to ſet up Popery and Arbitrary Power.</p>
            <p>That the Priſoner ſaid he expected ſome ſport at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and would go thither, and <hi>would be one who ſhould ſeize the King, if he ſhould ſeize any of the</hi> Members; That upon a Diſcourſe of diſarming the City, the Priſoner ſaid, that if the Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi> or the <hi>King</hi> himſelf ſhould come to do it, he would be the Death of him; rather than he ſhould take away his Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59848:59"/>
               <hi>Haynes</hi> Witneſſed, That the
<hi>Priſoner</hi> told him, that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould be called to an Account for all his Actions, for, it was notorious, <hi>That he reſolved to Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Popery and Arbitrary Power.</hi>—And that no <hi>King</hi> of his Race ſhould ever Reign in <hi>England</hi> after him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Turbervile</hi> ſaid, That the <hi>Priſoner</hi> told him at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that there was no good to be expected from the <hi>King, for he and all his Family were Papiſts.</hi> That he wiſhed the
<hi>King</hi> would begin, and ſaid, but if he do not, We will begin with him, and ſeize him; for there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral brave Fellows about this Town, that will ſecure him, till we have thoſe terms we expect; adding, <hi>That he had got a Caſe of Piſtols, and a very good Sword and a Velvet-Cap. (This Mr Atturney repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, to be Armour Cap a Pe.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place <hi>Sr George Jefferies</hi> brought againſt the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> one Mr <hi>Robert Maſters, whom he recommended to the</hi> Jury, <hi>as a Gentleman of an undoubted toping Reputation;</hi> and he ſwore that <hi>Mr Colledge</hi> in diſcourſe with him, had juſtified the Proceedings of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of 1640. And that the laſt
<hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters-Parliament,</hi> was of the Opinion<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59848:60"/>with that <hi>Parliament;</hi> And that he the ſaid
<hi>Maſters,</hi> having in a pleaſant way ſaluted <hi>Colledge,</hi> by the name of <hi>Colonel,</hi> he ſaid, don't mock me, I may be one in a little time.</p>
            <p>Then Sr <hi>William Jennings</hi> teſtified, That Mr
<hi>Colledge</hi> was ſhewing a <hi>Picture,</hi> to a Crowd of ſeven or eight or ten Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and gave one of the Pictures to him, which he gave to Juſtice <hi>Warcup.</hi> That the next day he ſaw
<hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> ſell a yard of <hi>Blew Ribbon</hi> (with the Words,
<hi>No Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, No Slavery,</hi> workt into it)
<note place="margin">Note how doth this ſtand with the A. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's Suggeſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Ribbon given for a Signal?</note> to a
<hi>Parliament-man</hi> in the <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> for 2 <hi>s. who tyed it upon his Sword.</hi> That Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> upon the day of the
<hi>Diſſolution</hi> of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> told him, that <hi>Mr Fitz. Gerald</hi> had ſpit in his face, and that they went to fifty Cuffs, and that he told Mr <hi>Colledge,</hi> that his Noſe bled, and he thereupon replied, <hi>I have loſt the firſt Blood in the Cauſe, but it will not be long before more be loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſome Contraſting with the <hi>Judges</hi> and
<hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Council,</hi> The Priſoner ſpoke to this effect. <hi>I don't queſtion but</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:59848:60"/>
               <hi>to prove this one of the moſt Helliſh</hi> Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies <hi>that ever was upon the face of the Earth, an abſolute Deſign to deſtroy all the</hi> Proteſtants
<hi>of</hi> England, <hi>that have had the Courage to oppoſe the</hi> Popiſh Plot; In which no Man of my Condition, has done more than I have done; I was bred a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> have ſo continued, and <hi>by the Grace of God will dye ſo</hi>—'Tis the greateſt Nonſence to believe, that I would ſay theſe things, to perſons whom I could never hope would conceal my <hi>Treaſons,</hi> having diſcovered their own. <hi>I had been a Fool,</hi> a Mad-man, <hi>to diſcover them to</hi> Papiſts, Prieſts
<hi>and</hi> Iriſh-Men; <hi>Men ready to ſtarve for Bread.</hi> Had I declared a deſign to ſeize the <hi>King</hi> when he was here at
<hi>Oxford, they neither would nor ought to have concealed it</hi>—I declare, as <hi>God</hi> is my <hi>Judge,</hi> that, <hi>had I had a deſign to ſeize the</hi> King, <hi>I know not of one Man upon the face of the Earth, to have ſtood by me; Parliament-Man,</hi> or other—I have a Soul that muſt live to Eternity, I would not call <hi>God</hi> to Witneſs to a Lye, to ſave One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Lives; <hi>This is a Villainous Conſpiracy, and if it take place againſt me, God knows how far it may go:</hi> This is the

            <p>Then the <hi>Priſoner</hi> called his Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>William Shewin</hi> teſtified, that <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervile</hi> told him, the week before at <hi>Charing Croſs,</hi> that there would be ſtrange things at <hi>Oxford</hi> againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> and he would lay ten to one,
<note place="margin">☞</note> that Mr <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel</hi> and Mr
<hi>Wilmore</hi> would be Hang'd at <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> and that he would lead Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> by the Gold-Chain about <hi>Fleet-Street.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Hickman</hi> teſtified that he over-heard <hi>Haynes</hi> ſay to a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> who Lodged in <hi>Hickman's-Houſe, God Damn me, I care not what I Swear, nor whom I Swear againſt, for it is my Trade to get Money by Swearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Mary Richards</hi> her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant teſtified, That <hi>Haynes</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, <hi>that he was employed, to turn the</hi> plot <hi>upon the</hi> Proteſtant Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Whaley</hi> teſtified, that about 6 years ago, <hi>Haynes ſtole a Silver Tankard from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Lun</hi> teſtifyed, that ſoon after the <hi>London Grand Jury</hi> had brought in their <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon <hi>the Indictment</hi> againſt <hi>Mr Colledge; Haynes</hi> in diſcourſe about it,<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59848:61"/>fell very foully upon that <hi>Jury,</hi> and
<hi>ſaid he would do the Earl of Shaftesbury</hi>'s <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and help the</hi> King <hi>to Money enough out of the</hi> Fanaticks
<hi>Eſtates,</hi> And that upon the laſt Munday, <hi>Haynes</hi> told him, that e'er long the <hi>King</hi> ſhould have <hi>Sheriff Bethel's</hi> Eſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Broadgate</hi> teſtified, that <hi>Turbervile</hi> told him that the <hi>King</hi>'s evidence were ſlighted and vilified, and
<hi>that he was tempted, with great offers, to diſown the</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot, <hi>and to turn to the other ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr <hi>Otes</hi> being called, <hi>produced</hi> to the
<hi>Court</hi> a <hi>Petition</hi> to the <hi>Common Council</hi> of
<hi>London,</hi> ſigned by <hi>Turbervile,</hi> &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they acknowledged, that they had been tempted to retract &amp; deny the Evidence they had given about the <hi>Popiſh Plot;</hi> and the <hi>Dr.</hi> teſtified, that <hi>Turbervile</hi> denyed to him that he had given evidence to the <hi>London grand Jury</hi> againſt <hi>Colledge;</hi> &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he could not give any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt him: That the <hi>Dr.</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards charging him with it, He ſaid, that the <hi>Proteſtant Citizens</hi> had deſerted them, and <hi>God damn him,</hi> he would not ſtarve.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dr.</hi> further teſtifyed that upon a quarrel between
<hi>Colledge</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> at <hi>Richard's Coffee-Houſe,</hi> he heard <hi>Smith</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:59848:62"/>
               <hi>ſwear God damn him he would have Colledge's Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Dugdale</hi> had told the <hi>Dr. that he knew nothing againſt any Proteſtant in England;</hi> that afterwards the <hi>Dr.</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that he had gone againſt his Conſcience; <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſaid, that he was neceſſitated to it, for he could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe get Money: and confeſſed that <hi>Colonel Warcup</hi> promiſed him a place in the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Samuel Smith</hi> and <hi>Mr Thomas Gardener</hi> teſtifyed, that <hi>Smith</hi> the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, did ſeveral times declare to them, that he <hi>believed a Popiſh Plot, but not any Proteſtant Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray</hi> teſtified, that
<hi>Smith</hi> endeavoured to ſuborn them, to Swear againſt <hi>Sr John Brookes</hi> of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> and <hi>Bolron</hi> added, that
<hi>Smith</hi> would have ſuborned him, to witneſs againſt the <hi>Earle of Shaftesbury</hi> and <hi>Colledge,</hi> teling him what he ſhould ſay, and that if he managed it rightly, he ſhould be made for ever.</p>
            <p>And that he had heard <hi>Haynes</hi> declare, that he knew nothing of a <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> nor of a <hi>Presbyterian Plot;</hi> but that <hi>he did not</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:59848:62"/>
               <hi>care what he ſwore, and would ſwear any thing to get money,</hi> and would be of that
<hi>Religion,</hi> which had the ſtrongeſt party.</p>
            <p>Then Mr <hi>Everard</hi> teſtified; That <hi>Smith</hi> told him very lately, <hi>that he knew of no Presbyterian or Proteſtant Plot;</hi> and that <hi>Juſtice Warcup</hi> would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him the ſaid
<hi>Everard</hi> to have ſworn a <hi>Presbyterian Plot.</hi> That
<hi>Haynes</hi> told him, that he was drove by neceſſity to ſwear againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> for he had but ſhort pay—And that the
<hi>Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's</hi> ſwearing againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was juſtly fallen upon them, for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in outing the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> of their Eſtates.</p>
            <p>The Priſoner after he had called theſe and many other Witneſſes (whoſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (though material) I do for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſake omit to tranſcribe) ſpoke thus;</p>
            <p>My Lord, <hi>I have no flouriſhes to ſet off my Defence; I cannot take the</hi> Jury, <hi>nor the</hi> Court <hi>with Oratory.—My Lord</hi> They have ſworn deſperately againſt me, and it appears they have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted one another; It has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that this was a
<hi>deſign:</hi> That they<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59848:63"/>were tampered withal; That they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained <hi>they were in Poverty;</hi> They confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they were tempted to come over to ſwear againſt <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and now, the
<hi>Lord</hi> knows, they have cloſed with it, and they begin with me.—There is never a Man that has ſworn againſt me, but has been ſufficiently confuted by Perſons of <hi>Integrity, Honeſty, Men of Principles,</hi> and <hi>Men of Religion,</hi> ſuch as make Conſcience of what they ſay.—I have been <hi>Lover</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> I never had a prejudice againſt any Man in the
<hi>Church</hi> in my Life, but ſuch as have made it their buſineſs to promote the Intereſt of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and ſuch there are amongſt them, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and allow none to be true <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but thoſe that are within the <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>eſtabliſhed by Law</hi>—I have been an hearty Man againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and for <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Bulwark of our Liberty</hi>—I have ever ſince the diſcovery of the <hi>Plot,</hi> endeavoured, with all my Heart and all my Power, to come to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it—Theſe Men that ſwear againſt me, uſed to follow me,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59848:63"/>and would ſay, <hi>that they came to ſave our Lives, and yet</hi> We <hi>let them want Bread;</hi> and the Argument was ſo fair, that, <hi>I thought it unreaſonable to ſee them ſtarve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Priſoner,</hi> afterwards ſpeaking to the
<hi>Judges,</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Life and your Souls lie at ſtake to do me Juſtice</hi>—My <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> have ſpoken materially, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what has been ſaid againſt me, to prove that <hi>this was done for Money,</hi> and that <hi>every one of them have confeſſed they were hired to it,</hi> and that <hi>they did it for a Livelyhood;</hi> And
<hi>Haynes, ſaid It was a good Trade; Damn him, he would do any thing for Money</hi>—I need inſiſt upon this no further; <hi>The whole Nation is ſenſible what is doing, and what this does ſignifie; They have begun with me, in order to the making of a</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Plot,</hi> which they would carry on to <hi>ſtifle the Noiſe of the</hi> Popiſh
<hi>Plot,</hi> and this is not the firſt, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, nor the tenth time that they have been at this Game; how many Shams have they endeavoured to raiſe?—I only deſire the <hi>Jury</hi> to take all into their ſerious conſideration; <hi>I expect a Storm of Thunder from the learned Counſel to fall upon me</hi>—and <hi>I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my ſelf without Counſel.</hi> I know<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59848:64"/>not whether it be the practiſe in any other <hi>Nation,</hi> but certainly 'tis hard meaſure, that I, being illiterate and ignorant in the Law, muſt ſtand here all day, They being many, and taking all advantages againſt me, and I a Single Perſon, and not able to uſe one means or another, either of writing or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—Then applying to the <hi>Jury</hi> (<hi>after a ſolemn Proteſtation of his Innocence</hi>) ſaid, I beſeech you, <hi>be not frightned nor flattered,</hi>—you are to acquit me or condemn me, and <hi>my Blood will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at your Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now comes Mr <hi>Solicitor</hi> to beſtow his Rhetorick upon the
<hi>Priſoner,</hi> ſaying; <hi>Here has been a great deal of time ſpent, and truly I think for no other Reaſon but to divert from the matter before you, and that you might forget the Evidence,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to refreſh your Memories, <hi>I ſhall repeat it:</hi> The <hi>Fact</hi> charged upon the Priſoner, <hi>is a deſign to Kill the King,</hi> the manifeſtation of that deſign is, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Armes</hi> to that purpoſe, and by coming down to ſeize the <hi>King</hi> here, <hi>the proof of it has been by Witneſſes, that I think by and by, you will have no Objections againſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:59848:64"/>Then, having recounted the Stories of the Witneſſes, he proceeds thus, The <hi>Objection</hi> made to this proof by the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> is, <hi>That this is a Popiſh deſign to raiſe a new Plot, and caſt it upon the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; And that theſe
<hi>Witneſſes</hi> are now to deny all the Evidence they have given of the
<hi>Popiſh Plot;</hi> This is that he would perſwade you to believe, but I
<hi>think it will be impoſſible for you to have ſuch a Thought; For what are the Evidence</hi> that have proved this? <hi>Men of Credit,</hi> that have been Evidences againſt the Popiſh Plotters, Men that ſtill ſtand to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they have given—<hi>And yet forſooth, theſe Men are going about to ſtifle this Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> Theſe are the Men the whole <hi>Nation</hi> has given Credit to, My Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> dyed upon the Credit of theſe Men, Theſe are the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that this Man thinks ought to be blown off, with that <hi>ſrivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Objection, that they are perſons,</hi> he would have you believe, <hi>Who are guilty of a deſign to throw the Plot upon the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> If <hi>Colledge</hi> have all this while under the name of a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:59848:65"/>acted the part of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> I may ſay, <hi>he is not that good Proteſtant he pretends to be.</hi> I muſt do him right, and repeat the Evidence he hath given againſt our Witneſſes; Mr <hi>Hickman</hi> ſays, he over-heard
<hi>Haynes</hi> ſay, <hi>it was his Trade to Swear, and he muſt get Money by it; Lun</hi> ſays, that <hi>Haynes</hi> declared the ſame thing to him.
<hi>Whaley</hi> ſays, <hi>that Haynes ſtole a Silver Tankard;</hi> but he was never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for it. I think the Nature of this Evidence hath not that weight, as to take off the Credit of what this Man hath ſaid upon his Oath, <hi>eſpecially being backt with the Evidence of</hi> Dugdale, Smtyh
<hi>and</hi> Turbervile, <hi>whoſe credit has not been impeached:</hi> Indeed Dr <hi>Otes</hi> is produced againſt them, <hi>and he muſt vilifie their Credit,</hi> whoſe <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> at firſt of the <hi>Popiſh Plot, received Credit by being ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe Men:</hi>
               <note place="margin">A thing much more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous was put in practice by the King's Council, when they produced the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:59848:65"/>
               <hi>the Doctor were again returning to</hi> St Omers.</p>
            <p>There are two Witneſſes, <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray,</hi> who teſtifie, <hi>That</hi> Smyth <hi>would have ſuborned them to ſwear againſt Sr John Brookes:</hi> But I think <hi>I need ſay no more to theſe Men, but only to deſire you to weigh their Credit;</hi> They have, I confeſs, been evidence againſt ſeveral that have been accuſed of the
<hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> but, <hi>they have been ſo unfortunate, that they were never yet believed, though they have been ſworn in their own Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[Note, This by the way was not true, for <hi>at Summer Aſſizes at York</hi> in 1680, Thwyng <hi>was convicted of the Plot, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards executed, and that upon the Teſtimony of theſe very men,</hi> Bolron

            <p>Mr <hi>Solicitor</hi> then cloſes thus,</p>
            <p>I think, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> this is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what has been offered againſt the <hi>King's Witneſſes,</hi> except that of Mr
<hi>Everard,</hi> who ſays ſomething againſt <hi>Haynes;</hi> that he ſhould ſay, <hi>he ſwore for ſelf-preſervation;</hi> And againſt Mr
<hi>Smyth,</hi> he ſays, that he heard him ſay, <hi>he did not know of any</hi> Presbyterian Plot.</p>
            <p>By theſe things (<hi>And by a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which had ſlip'd the Memory of the</hi>

               <hi>Solicitor, and alſo of the Chief Juſtice</hi>) he hath endeavoured to take off the credit of our

<hi>work.</hi>—I think it a great piece of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance for him, to take upon him the Title of a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> when he hath abuſed that title by ſuch unſuitable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices—<hi>I cannot but reflect upon the condition of this Man, whoſe onely hope is, that you ſhould now forget your ſelves and become as ill as he is, But as that cannot be preſumed, ſo I ſhall not need to ſay any more to you.</hi>

            <p>After the making of very long <hi>Speeches</hi> to the

            </p>
            <p>At the place of Execution upon the 31ſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi>
1681. he behaved himſelf with great Courage and Conſtancy, and expreſſed himſelf to this effect,</p>
            <p>He <hi>profeſſed</hi> in the preſence of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, That he was ſo far from being Guilty of thoſe Treaſons falſly ſworn againſt him by the wretched and mercenary Men,</hi> Dugdale, Turbervile, Smyth <hi>and</hi> Haynes, <hi>that he never ſpoke ſo much as one ſingle word of thoſe Treaſons to them, or either of them;</hi> or ever heard them ſpoke, till ſworn in the <hi>Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He declared, that <hi>Haynes</hi> had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> was to be deſtroyed at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and that

<hi>Farwell</hi> owned the carrying the firſt, and <hi>Paine</hi> the carrying the ſecond to <hi>Thompſon.</hi> After reading theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Court; <hi>Thompſon</hi>'s <hi>Intelligence</hi> of the 17<hi>th</hi> of

            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:59848:70"/>
               <hi>There is not in the ſaid Letter</hi> (meaning the ſaid firſt Letter) <hi>the leaſt Item or Circumſtance, but what will be by undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evidence made out to be Truth, ſo that</hi> Mr Prance, <hi>having not as yet vouchſafed an Anſwer to that Letter; he will ſpeedily receive a further Letter, relating to that Murther, wherein the further truth will be ſet forth, and other Circumſtances ſet out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of thoſe <hi>Intelligences</hi> of March 11<hi>th,</hi>
1681. given in Evidence, ran thus; <hi>Whereas</hi> Dick Janeway <hi>in this days Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, promiſes an Anſwer to the late Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to</hi> Mr Prance, &amp;c. <hi>This is to give him, and all the World notice, that ſuch an Anſwer is impatiently expected by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Letter, who queſtions not but to prove every tittle of that Letter, to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all Mankind;</hi> and then it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to challenge the <hi>Lord Mayor, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen,</hi> and Common-Council, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the truth of that Letter; and ſays, <hi>That then the Fraud and Blindneſs put upon the World, in Relation to the Murther of</hi> Sr Edmundbury Godfry <hi>will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third of theſe <hi>Intelligences,</hi> took a further ſtep, glorying, in an imagined<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59848:71"/>victory in this matter, for it ſayes <hi>Laſt Wedneſday Nathaniel Thompſon, upon Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons appeared before the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, about the Letters to Mr</hi> Prance
<hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the death of Sr</hi> Edmunbury Godfry, <hi>where he juſtified the matter, and produced the Authors who are ready to prove (by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable and ſub ſtantial Witneſſes, &amp;c.) that every tittle and jot a of theſe Letters are true, And</hi> after adds, Mr <hi>Thompſon, and the Gentlemen, his Friends are to attend the next Wedneſday at Council, where they do not doubt, but that honourable Board, will put them into a Method, to prove the whole, or any particular, which their Honours, in their great Wiſdom ſhall think convenient to be brought to the Teſt, or Examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An honeſt <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> can never better expreſs his admiration and deteſtation of the tranſcendent impudence, of theſe vile
<hi>Miſcreants,</hi> then in the Language of the late famous <hi>Baron of Wem,</hi> upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, with a ſmall alteration of Words,
<hi>Good God! whither were we run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when many eaſie People were ſo ſtrangely wrought upon by theſe Impoſtors, and when the villainous and black Deſigns of ſome evil Inſtruments among us, were ſo powerfully abetted and countenanced, that</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59848:71"/>
               <hi>they were arrived to this degree of aſſurance, that they could beguile and delude, not only ſome of the Shepherds of our Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>with their ſilly innocent Flocks; but even the King and his Privy-Council, into the belief of ſo horrid a falſhood; and that at a time when not a hidden, but a deeply contrived and detected Treaſon was carryed on amongſt us, for extirpating our Religion,</hi> (termed the Northern Hereſie) <hi>our Laws and Liberties; The Conſpirators had a fair Game of it, whilſt theſe Fellows were believed; and they needed no other means to compleat their deſign; I cannot but ſay, my Blood does curdle, and my Spirits are raiſed, to ſee fellows ſo impudent, as to brazen it out, as theſe monſtrous Villains do; the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Souls, the baſeneſs of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ought to be lookt upon with ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and deteſtation, as to think them unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy any longer to tread upon the face of God's Earth.</hi> But, to return to the matter in hand, from which I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed;</p>
            <p>It being, as aforeſaid made out, that the Defendants had publiſhed, that, what was teſtified againſt the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Sr Edmundbury Godfry</hi> was a lye; Mr <hi>Saunders</hi> and Mr <hi>Gooding,</hi> Counſel<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59848:72"/>for <hi>Paine,</hi> declared it was a raſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed Act, but not out of Malice; and that he was ſorry for what he had done, and had offered to give any Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>To whom the Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>To me he ſaid he would make it out by five hundred Witneſſes,</hi> they would make it as plain as the day<hi>:</hi> and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor <hi>Thompſon</hi> added; ſince the laſt time that was appointed for the Tryal, they have printed that they would prove it by ſixty Witneſſes; and were very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it did not come on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Yalden,</hi> Counſel for <hi>Thompſon,</hi> ſaid, that he thought his Client was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately drawn into the buſineſs by
<hi>Paine</hi> and <hi>Farwell,</hi> who turn all upon him now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Osborne,</hi> Counſel for <hi>Farwell,</hi> ſaid, It was a fooliſh thing, to do as he had done, but, that his Client ſaid he had ſeveral Witneſſes, who being called; it was manifeſt that
<hi>Farwell</hi> deſigned, to have even then, raiſed a doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Sr Edmundbury Godfry</hi> was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, or not; but it appeared, that of the eleven or twelve Witneſſes he called, there was not one but was as much againſt him as could be; for they did plainly evince it, that Sr
<hi>Edmundbury</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:59848:72"/>
               <hi>Godfry</hi> was Killed, and that by Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſo confirmed the evidence given againſt <hi>Green, Berry and Hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It being thus manifeſted, <hi>that this was a curſed combination to affront the publick juſtice of the Nation;</hi> and that done, to the end, to perſwade the World, there was <hi>no Popiſh Plot.</hi> The
<hi>Jury,</hi> without ſtirring from the Bar found them all three guilty of the Information; and the judgment was, that <hi>Farwell</hi> and
<hi>Thompſon</hi> ſhould ſtand in the Pillory in the
<hi>Palace-Yard,</hi> for one hour, the laſt day of the Term, and each of them pay 100 <hi>l.</hi> Fine, and to be Impriſoned till paid; and that
<hi>Paine</hi> ſhould only pay 100 <hi>l.</hi> Fine, and be impriſoned till paid. Upon the 5th of <hi>July</hi> 1682. according to the judgment,
<hi>Thompſon</hi> and <hi>Farwell</hi> ſtood in the <hi>Pillory</hi> with this Writing over their Heads, <hi>For Libelling the Juſtice of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by making the World believe, that Sr</hi> Edmundbury Godfry <hi>murdered himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' this bold and daring Contrivance of theſe
<hi>Champions</hi> for <hi>Holy Church,</hi> was thus happily defeated, and their own Counſel did not only declare that it was an unadviſed undertaking, but ſome of their own Gang began to ſay that the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59848:73"/>
               <hi>Devil</hi> owed them a ſham; yet, no doubt of it the deſign was better laid, then ſome imagined. But what fence for ill luck? They did confidently relie upon the <hi>Council-Board</hi> to cheriſh the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and to inſtruct the proſecution thereof, and nothing diſappointed them there, but an unlucky miſtimeing the matter. They alſo knew full well, that the credit of <hi>Popery</hi> muſt be reſtored and that, by ſuppreſſing the evidence of their Plot, and that if one thing failed, another would hit; they remembred the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of one of the Guides of the hare-brain'd <hi>Toryes, Heraclitus Ridens, who fore-told, ſoon after the election of Sr</hi> John Moore <hi>to be Lord Mayor; that at or before</hi> 1683. <hi>they ſhould have Juries for their turn,</hi> and, that then talking to the <hi>Whiggs</hi> about hanging, that <hi>Author</hi> with great aſſurance told them, <hi>They muſt come to't, and ſhould come to't;</hi> ſo that all had been Cock-ſure, if they had tim'd it, ſo as to have had it tryed, before any one of the corrupt and <hi>murdering Juryes,</hi> which that year of 1683. furniſhed for my <hi>Lord Ruſſel, Colonel Sidney,</hi> and others.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Conſpirators,</hi> having in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Year
1681, delivered themſelves from the <hi>danger of Parliaments:</hi> They well knew that there then ſtood nothing in their way, but the old faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, abhorred way of <hi>Tryals</hi> by <hi>Juryes:</hi> Therefore, they muſt now (to cut off all who ſtood in their way) have <hi>Jury-Men,</hi> as they had already <hi>Judges, at their own Nomination and Devotion,</hi> ſo</p>
            <p>In <hi>October</hi> 1681, <hi>Sr John Moore</hi> is made <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> than which<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59848:74"/>(to the diſcerning part of Mankind) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more portentous, nor of worſe

            </p>
            <p>The great care now is, how to get ſuch <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> as would furniſh proper <hi>Juryes</hi> to ſerve the turn; for ſecuring this great point, the <hi>Mayor</hi> is cloſely plyed by their little
<hi>Engines</hi> in the <hi>City;</hi> and directed to inſiſt upon a pretended <hi>Prerogative,</hi> to elect one of the <hi>Sheriffs;</hi> This point being gained upon him, they bethink themſelves of a fit Man; and incline to Sr <hi>Benjamin Newland,</hi> but at length they pitch upon Mr
<hi>North</hi> (<hi>late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned from</hi> Turkey, <hi>Brother to the Lord Chief Juſtice North</hi>) He readily embraces the Employment, and before the day for election of <hi>Sheriffs</hi> was come (a thing never before known) he ſeals a <hi>Bond</hi> to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Aldermen,</hi> to hold
<hi>Sheriff;</hi> and the <hi>Gazette proclaims it to the World, that the</hi> Lord May or <hi>had elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Dudley North <abbr>Esq</abbr>

               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:59848:74"/>The <hi>Conſpirators</hi> and the
<hi>Mayor,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus acted the matter by concert,
<hi>Midſummer-day,</hi> the accuſtomed time for Election of
<hi>Sheriffs,</hi> being come; the <hi>Mayor</hi> inſiſts to have Mr
<hi>North</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as one of the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> and his Party put up Mr <hi>Box</hi> to be joyned with him; But the <hi>Citizens</hi> withſtood the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yor</hi>'s Uſurpation upon their undoubted Rights; and proceeded according to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial Cuſtom, to Elect their <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs;</hi> and fixed upon thoſe well-deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and eminent <hi>Citizens,</hi> Mr
<hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr <hi>Dubois;</hi> who were choſen upon the view, by a very great majority of <hi>Voices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon, to gain time for Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, how to trick this
<hi>Election;</hi> the <hi>Accomplices</hi> of the <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> demand a <hi>Poll,</hi> that being yielded to them; the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> went upon the takeing the <hi>Poll;</hi> and it being far proceeded upon, and it appearing that there were two to one of the <hi>Electors,</hi> polled for Mr
<hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr <hi>Dubois;</hi> the <hi>Mayor</hi> was ſent with a
<hi>Rabble,</hi> in a <hi>Tumultuous</hi> manner, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the finiſhing the <hi>Poll,</hi> by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing the Court.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> Mr <hi>Pillington</hi> and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59848:75"/>Mr <hi>Shute,</hi> well knowing the <hi>Managment</hi> of the <hi>Election</hi> to belong to them; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome time to proceed in take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Poll,</hi> and then adjourned to the Tueſday following.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſpirators</hi> call this a Riot, (<hi>as in truth it was of their own ſide</hi>) and the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> commit the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and there lock them up, till, by an unlucky <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inſtrument, called an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> the <hi>Tower</hi> Gates were forced open; they nevertheleſs with undaunted reſolution, perſiſted to aſſert their own and the
<hi>Citizens</hi> Rights; and declared <hi>Mr Papillon</hi> and <hi>Mr Dubois,</hi> to be Elected <hi>Sheriffs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then it was propoſed and conſented to, that a new
<hi>Poll</hi> ſhould be taken; which being done, it appeared, that Mr
<hi>North</hi> had 170 <hi>Voices,</hi> Mr <hi>Box</hi> 1353. and Mr
<hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr <hi>Dubois,</hi> upwards of 2700. and they are a ſecond time declared to be Elected <hi>Sheriffs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon, upon the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> divers eminent
<hi>Citizens</hi> attended the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> of
<hi>Aldermen;</hi> and for themſelves, and on behalf of the reſt of the
<hi>Citizens,</hi> demanded, that they would cauſe <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59848:75"/>made, for Mr <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr <hi>Dubois,</hi> to appear and ſeal Bonds, according to Cuſtom; to take the Office of
<hi>Sheriffs;</hi> And at the ſame time, they entered a <hi>Cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,</hi> to Mr <hi>Wagſtaffe</hi> the <hi>Town-Clerk,</hi> againſt the ſwearing and admitting, Mr <hi>North</hi> and Mr <hi>Box, Sheriffs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sr <hi>L. Jenkins,</hi> and the influence of <hi>Saunders,</hi> and of <hi>Jefferies</hi> (both declared Enemies to the City Rights, and at that time, of
<hi>Council</hi> with the <hi>Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> for the overthrow of their
<hi>Antient Charters</hi>) aſſumes the boldneſs to declare, both Mr
<hi>North</hi> and Mr <hi>Box, Sheriffs;</hi> and ſo raviſhes from the
<hi>Citizens,</hi> the right to Elect either of the <hi>Sheriffs;</hi> But Mr
<hi>Box</hi> appearing to be endued with a better ſtock of Diſcretion, than to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Office, upon that Title, declined it; Whereupon 'tis reſolved that Mr <hi>Rich</hi> ſhall be the Man, and a <hi>Common-Hall</hi> being called, a little before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> where, tho' above ten to one were found againſt <hi>Rich,</hi> yet, the <hi>Common Serjeant</hi> (<hi>who was deeply engaged in the Intrigue</hi>) makes report to the <hi>Mayor; as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerted;</hi> that Mr <hi>Rich</hi> was Elected,<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59848:76"/>and ſo, without more to do, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Mr <hi>North</hi>'s Partner.</p>
            <p>Upon the day for ſwearing the new <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> being
<hi>Michaelmas-Eve,</hi> 1682. The <hi>Citizens</hi> went in a very great Body to <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> to preſent Mr <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr

            <p>Then comes Sr <hi>George Jefferies</hi> (<hi>the main Contriver and Abettor of the Lord Mayor</hi>'s moſt daring and unjuſtifiable attempt) and tells the <hi>Jury;</hi> That the <hi>Rabble</hi> came upon my <hi>Lord Mayor;</hi> had him down upon his Knees, and if ſome <hi>Gentlemen</hi> had not come in, they had trod him under feet; He then called <hi>Sr William Hooker,</hi> Mr <hi>Lightfoote,</hi> Mr <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Common Serjeant,</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cryer,</hi> the <hi>Sword-Bearer,</hi> and Mr

            <p>The <hi>Common Serjeant</hi> evidenced, that he heard them (<hi>but could name no Perſon</hi>) cry out, No <hi>God Bleſs the King; down with the Sword; No Lord Mayor; No King.</hi> And he affirmed, <hi>that he had the ſole management of Elections of</hi> Sheriffs, <hi>as the Duty of his Place.</hi>

               <hi>Deputy Sibley</hi> then teſtified, that he had been of the

            <p>Sr <hi>Simon Lewis</hi> and Sr <hi>Jonathan Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> who were <hi>Sheriffs</hi> in Sr <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>'s <hi>Mayoralty,</hi> then ſaid, That upon the firſt day of Election of <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> adjourned the <hi>Court;</hi> and that afterwards they only appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from day to day till the <hi>Poll</hi> was ended.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Common Serjeant</hi> out-ſtripped theſe

<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> it is hoped you will ſettle the <hi>City,</hi> by deſtroying this pretence, which has been fluttering in the Air, but hath no ground for it.</p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſumming up the matter, told the <hi>Jury;</hi> That the <hi>Rioters</hi> would make the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> the Men; and that the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> was no body; and <hi>that it was ſomething of the</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth <hi>Seed, that was like to grow up</hi>

<hi>Conſpirators,</hi> finding their meaſures to be broken, as indeed were thoſe of the <hi>French King</hi> all over <hi>Europe;</hi> they adviſed
<hi>King Charles the Second,</hi> to make uſe of the Diſcovery, as a Cripple, to beg Money of the then approaching <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was immediately to ſit; for the better effecting thereof, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious
<hi>Clergy</hi> were privately inſtructed to Preach againſt
<hi>Popery,</hi> and to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Diſcovery of the Plot; this Doctrine was thundered out from the Pulpits, till the Diſſolution of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
<hi>Pentionary Parliament.</hi> Having then found their hopes daſh'd, new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were given, and the <hi>Clergy</hi> advertiſed that there was ſome fear from the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> but yet for a time, they were to Preach againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> but not to talk of the <hi>Plot;</hi> this humour conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi>

<hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> as well as a <hi>Popiſh plot;</hi> this made the
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical Drums</hi> beat loudly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and that work was cloſely followed, till the breaking the <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the beginning of the year 1681. When the <hi>Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> influenced too many of the
<hi>Pulpits,</hi> to thunder againſt the credit of the <hi>Popiſh plot,</hi> and to inſinuate a belief of a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Plot;</hi> which they were all the while hammering; and by this art, they did at length uſher it into the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Nobility and Gentry of England,</hi> to make bold with their own words in their <hi>Memorial</hi> for our now Gracious <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> then <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of
<hi>Orange;</hi> had been, as they therein freely confeſſed, <hi>too ſlow to believe the deſperate</hi> Popiſh Plot, <hi>and had been delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the</hi> King's <hi>Promiſes to protect and maintain the</hi> Proteſtant Religion, <hi>and the</hi> Laws <hi>and</hi> Government of England; <hi>until they ſaw them all undermined:</hi> But many diſcerning this
<hi>Deluſion,</hi> more early than others did, the never to be

<hi>and</hi> Liberties, <hi>when Invaded and taken from them, under pretence and colour of Law;</hi> began to bethink themſelves how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
<hi>Parliaments</hi> to their antient free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to deliver the
<hi>Nation</hi> from the fury of that <hi>Torrent</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> which they wiſely fore-ſaw ready to break in and carry all before it.</p>
            <p>At this juncture the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> laid hold of the
<hi>Information</hi> given by <hi>Keeling,</hi> of unadviſed and raſh Diſcourſes of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall number of Men, (nine or ten at the moſt, all Strangers to the Perſons and honeſt Conſultations of thoſe great Men before named) and they cunningly and maliciouſly,

<hi>Eſſex,</hi> my <hi>Lord Ruſſell,</hi> and <hi>Colonel Sidney,</hi> would not be overcome by the perſwaſions of thoſe who invited them to ſafe retirements; and ſo were clap'd into the <hi>Tower,</hi> and afterwards, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent wayes butchered.</p>
            <p>It was reſolved that my <hi>Lord Ruſſell</hi> (<hi>the Honour of his Age</hi>) ſhould be cut off in a ſeeming way of
<hi>Juſtice;</hi> and as he was a <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>ineſtimable value,</hi> ſo the art uſed to deſtroy him was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; in the firſt place, The <hi>Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> to introduce a belief of his

            <p>The Jury being called, his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> was over-ruled in his <hi>Challenges,</hi> of thoſe of them, who were not <hi>Freeholders;</hi> though the learned in the Laws, did and do ſay, that he was entituled to thoſe <hi>Challenges not of Grace but Right;</hi> and the ſame was allowed to others by my <hi>Lord's Proſecutors,</hi> at ſuch Seaſons, when it would not diſſerve their turn; thus the <hi>Eſtate, Honour</hi> and

            <p>I ſhall not here trouble the <hi>Reader,</hi> with the particulars of the Evidence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt this <hi>Noble Lord,</hi> by the
<hi>Lord Howard, Colonel Romſey,</hi> and <hi>Mr Shepheard;</hi> nor offer at any <hi>Remarks</hi> thereupon, much leſs to touch upon the many Hardſhips and great Injuſtice put upon his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> in this Proſecution, in point of Law; all that having been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably well done, by the Learned Pens of the right <hi>Honourable the Lord Chief Baron Atkyns,</hi> and of <hi>Mr Hawles</hi> of <hi>Lincolns Inn,</hi> My purpoſe, not only in extracting theſe Notes in my <hi>Lord Ruſſell's</hi> Caſe; but alſo in this whole Tract; being only to preſent the World with ſome matters of Hiſtory, which they did not put down, or remark upon; and (which indeed invited me to this<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59848:92"/>work) to gather together, for publick uſe, Abſtracts and Remarks upon ſome memorable <hi>Tryals</hi> in the late unhappy <hi>Reigns;</hi> upon which they never touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore now proceed, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſomething further of the carriage and exaſperating Speeches of the <hi>King's Council,</hi> &amp;c. againſt his <hi>Lordſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Solicitor General</hi> ſum'd up the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in this manner, <hi>That the Priſoner ſtood Indicted for High Treaſon in conſpiring the Death of the King,</hi> That the <hi>Overt Act,</hi> laid to prove that <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> by, is the aſſembling in <hi>Council,</hi> to raiſe Arms againſt the <hi>King,</hi> and to raiſe a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and that they had proved that, by three Witneſſes; He then proceeded to ſtate the ſubſtance of the Evidence, <hi>which having done as he thought fit;</hi> he added, That my <hi>Lord Ruſſell</hi> had made ſeveral
<hi>Objections,</hi> and then he pretended to anſwer them, and in doing it, ſaid, <hi>That their Conſultation</hi> was <hi>to ſeize the</hi> King's
<hi>Perſon,</hi> and bring him into their power, and, <hi>that to deſign to bring the King into their power, only till he had conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſuch things as ſhould be moved in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, was equally Treaſon, as if they had</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:59848:92"/>
               <hi>agreed directly to Aſſaſſinate him</hi>—That therefore, the <hi>Jury</hi> were to conſider no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to ſee that the fact be fully proved, and <hi>he ſaw nothing ſaid by my</hi> Lord <hi>that doth invalidate the Evidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He went on thus, That the laſt <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> (to which a great many Perſons of Honour and Quality had been called) was, <hi>That my</hi> Lord Ruſſell <hi>being a man of Honour, Vertue and ſo little blamable in his whole Converſation; 'twas not likely he ſhould be guilty of any thing of this kind,</hi> This he confeſſed to have weight in it, but then he bad the <hi>Jury conſider that he was but a man,</hi> and that Men fall by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Temptations,</hi> ſome out of <hi>Revenge,</hi> ſome by <hi>Malice</hi> fall into ſuch Offences as theſe; my <hi>Lord</hi> is not of this Temper, but <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> there is another great and dangerous <hi>Temptation</hi> that attends people in his Circumſtances; whether it be <hi>Pride, or Ambition, or the cruel ſnare of Popularity,</hi> being cryed up as a <hi>Patron of Liberty;</hi> This is the only way to tempt Perſons of V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtue, and the
<hi>Devil</hi> knew it, when he tempted the <hi>Pattern of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue—Tho' he be a Perſon of Vertue, I am afraid theſe Temptations have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my</hi> Lord, for I cannot give my <pb n="166" facs="tcp:59848:93"/>ſelf any colour of Objection to diſ-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all theſe Witneſſes; <hi>I ſee no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, no Correſpondence, no Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance at all between them,</hi> you have plain Oathes before you, and I hope you will conſider the weight of them, and the great Conſequence that did attend this Caſe,
<note place="margin">But under his favour, theſe celebrated
<hi>VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> were at Bargain, and bought their own lives at the price of this Noble <hi>Lord's</hi> Blood.</note> 
               <hi>the overthrow of the beſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, and the beſt and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Religion,</hi> which muſt needs have ſuffered. <hi>The greateſt liberty and the greateſt ſecurity for Property that ever was in any Nation, bounded every way by the Rules of Law and thoſe kept ſacred, I hope</hi> you will conſider
<note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>the weight of this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and conſider the Conſequences ſuch a</hi> Conſpiracy <hi>might have had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Jefferies,</hi> to Inſinuate this <hi>Noble Lord's</hi> Guilt, argued thus, <hi>Had not my</hi> Lord of Eſſex <hi>been conſcious of his being guilty of deſperate things, he would ſcarcely have brought himſelf to that untimely End, to avoid the methods of publick</hi> Juſtice.—I am ſorry to find that there have been ſo many of the Nobility of this Land, that have lived ſo happily under the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59848:93"/>benigne influence of a <hi>Gracious Prince,</hi> ſhould make ſo ill returns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> whereas that <hi>Noble Lord</hi> ſays, he hath a <hi>vertuous good</hi> Lady, he hath many Children, he hath Vertue and Honour, he puts in the Scale. I muſt tell you on the other ſide, <hi>you have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Religion,</hi> you have a <hi>Prince,</hi> and a moſt merciful one too; Conſider the Life of your Prince, <hi>the Life of his Poſterity,</hi> the Conſequences that would have attended, if this
<hi>Villany</hi> had taken effect, What would have become of your Lives and Religion? <hi>What would have become of that Religion we have been ſo fond of preſerving—You have your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,</hi> your Wives and Children, let not the Greatneſs of any man Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt you.</p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
<hi>Jury,</hi> told them (after he had repeated the evidence) that the
<hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> before them was, <hi>whether they did believe my</hi> Lord Ruſſell <hi>had any deſign upon the King's Life,</hi> to deſtroy the
<hi>King,</hi> to take away his Life, and <hi>that that was the material part there</hi>—you have not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in this Caſe, as there was in the other matter, that was tryed in the<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59848:94"/>morning, or yeſterday, againſt the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators</hi> to kill the <hi>King</hi> at the <hi>Rye—This is an Act of contriving Rebellion and an Inſurrection, and to ſeize the Guards; which is urged as an evidence, and ſurely is in it ſelf an evidence to ſeize and deſtroy the</hi> King—If you believe the <hi>Priſoner</hi> at the Bar, to have conſpired the death of the <hi>King,</hi> and in order to that, to have had theſe Conſults, then you muſt find him guilty of this <hi>Treaſon</hi> laid to his Charge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Court</hi> then adjourned, and at their ſitting again in the Afternoon, the <hi>Jury</hi> brought in their <hi>Verdict,</hi> that my
<hi>Lord Ruſſell,</hi> was Guilty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here, to refreſh the Readers memory, ſubjoyn ſome brief Heads of the dying <hi>Speech</hi> of this great and invaluable Perſon,
<hi>a Martyr for the true Religion and the Liberties of his Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He thanked <hi>God,</hi> that he found himſelf ſo compoſed and prepared for Death, and his thoughts ſo fixed on another World, that he hoped in <hi>God,</hi> he was quite weaned from ſetting his heart on this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:59848:94"/>He bleſſed <hi>God</hi> for the many Bleſſings of his Life, <hi>That he was born of worthy good Parents, and had the advantages of a Religious Education,</hi> which he had look'd upon as an invaluable Bleſſing, for when he minded it leaſt, it ſtill hung about him, and gave him checks; and that he now, in his extremity, found ſuch happy effects of it, that the fear of Death had not been able to diſcompoſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he had lived and now dyed of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, a true &amp; ſincere Proteſtant,</hi> and in the Communion of the Church of
<hi>England, tho' he could never riſe up to all the heights of ſome People.</hi> He wiſhed the removal of all our unhappy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, <hi>and that all ſincere Proteſtants would conſider the danger of Popery, and lay aſide their Heats, and agree againſt the Common Enemy;</hi> That the
<hi>Church-men</hi> would be leſs ſevere, and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> leſs ſcrupulous.</p>
            <p>He declared, <hi>that he look'd upon Popery as an Idolatrous and bloody Religion;</hi> and therefore thought himſelf bound in his ſtation to do all he could againſt it; and ſoreſaw that he ſhould procure ſuch great and powerful Enemies to himſelf,<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59848:95"/>
               <hi>that he had been for ſome time expecting the worſt;</hi> and <hi>bleſſed God that he fell by the Ax, and not by the fiery Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That, yet he never had a thought of doing any thing againſt
<hi>Popery, baſely or inhumanly; but what could well conſiſt with the</hi> Chriſtian Religion, <hi>and the</hi> Laws <hi>and</hi> Liberties
<hi>of the</hi> Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That he had always loved his Country more than his Life, and
<hi>never had any deſign of changing the Government,</hi> and would have ventured his Life to preſerve it; <hi>and would have ſuffered any extremity, rather than have conſented to any deſign to take away the King's Life;</hi> and that no Man ever had the Impudence to propoſe ſo baſe and barbarous a thing to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he ſincerely prayed for the King; that he might be happy both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He took <hi>God</hi> to witneſs, that in the proſecution of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the ſincerity of his Heart—<hi>that he did ſtill believe that Popery was breaking in upon the Nation;</hi> and that thoſe who advance it, will ſtop at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<hi>and declared his ſorrow that ſo many Proteſtants gave their, helping hand to it;</hi> But he declared his hope, that <hi>God</hi> would
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59848:95"/>preſerve the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and the
<hi>Nation; though he feared it would fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der very great Tryals, and ſharp Sufferings.</hi> That the bare-fac'd <hi>Prophaneneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety</hi> in the <hi>Nation, gave Reaſon to fear the worſt things that could befal a People.</hi> He prayed <hi>God</hi> to prevent it, and give thoſe, who ſhewed concern for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good; and appear'd hearty for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion; Grace to live ſo that they might not caſt a reproach on that which they endeavoured to advance;</hi> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared had often given him many ſad thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to his condition,</hi> he ſaid, he had no repining in his Heart at it; and did freely forgive all the World, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe concerned in taking away his Life; and <hi>conjured his Friends to think of no Revenge, but to ſubmit to the holy will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He declared, as to his appearing in the buſineſs of the
<hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> that he thought the <hi>Nation</hi> in ſuch danger of <hi>Popery,</hi> and that the expectation of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi> put the <hi>King's</hi> Life in ſuch danger, that he ſaw no way ſo effectual to ſecure both, as that Bill; and that he thought,
<hi>his earneſtneſs in that matter had</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:59848:96"/>
               <hi>no ſmall influence in his preſent Sufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to his conſpiring to <hi>ſeize the Guards,</hi> the Crime for which he was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which was made <hi>a conſtructive Treaſon</hi> to take away the <hi>King's</hi> Life, to bring it within the
<hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> 3. His <hi>Lordſhip</hi> gave this account. That he never was at <hi>Shepherd's</hi> but once, and that there was no undertaking then, of ſecuring or <hi>ſeizing the Guards,</hi> nor none appointed to view or examine them: Some diſcourſe there was about the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſableneſs of it, and he heard it ſeveral times by accident in general diſcourſe elſewhere, <hi>but never conſented to it as fit to be done,—That the Duke of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth <hi>exclaimed againſt it,</hi> and his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſaid that he ever obſerved in him an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of all baſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He thanked <hi>God,</hi> that his part was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and well meant; he obſerved, that it was inferred that he was acquainted with <hi>the Heats and ill Deſigns</hi> of ſome great Men, and did not diſcover them, but that that was but <hi>miſpriſion of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> at moſt; and ſo he dyed innocent of the Crime he ſtood condemned for; and hoped,
<hi>that no body would imagine that ſo mean a thought could enter into him,</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:59848:96"/>
               <hi>as to go about to ſave his Life, by accuſing others;</hi> The part that ſome had acted late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that kind, had not been ſuch, as to invite him to love Life at ſuch a rate.</p>
            <p>He declared; that he <hi>could not but think the ſentence upon him very hard,</hi> for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſworn againſt him (<hi>whether true or falſe</hi>) but diſcourſes about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome ſtirs.—That
<hi>by a ſtrange fetch,</hi> the <hi>ſtory of ſeizing the Guards, was conſtrued a deſign of killing</hi> the King; and ſo he was caſt in that.</p>
            <p>He prayed <hi>God,</hi> not to lay it to the charge of the
<hi>King's Counſel,</hi> the <hi>Judges, Sheriffs</hi> or <hi>Jury;</hi> That, for the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> he pittied and wiſhed them well, and ſhould not reckon up the particulars wherein they wronged him; but had rather their own <hi>Conſciences</hi> ſhould do that; to which, and the mercies of
<hi>God,</hi> he left them.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Lordſhip</hi> added, that from the time of chuſing
<hi>Sheriffs,</hi> he concluded, that the heat in that matter, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſomething of this kind, and that he was not much ſurprized to find it fall upon himſelf, and <hi>wiſhed that his Blood might ſatiate ſome Peoples Revenge</hi>—He wiſhed thoſe <hi>Gentlemen of the Law,</hi> who have great readineſs in<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59848:97"/>ſpeaking, would make more Conſcience in the uſe of it, and <hi>not run Men down by ſtrains and fetches;</hi> and <hi>impoſe on eaſie and willing</hi> Juryes, <hi>to the ruin of innocent Men;</hi> for <hi>to kill by forms and ſubtilties of Law, is the worſt ſort of Murder.</hi> He further wiſhed, that <hi>the rage of hot Men and the partiality of Juries</hi> might be ſtop'd with his Blood, and ſaid, he ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it up with more joy, if he thought he ſhould be the laſt to ſuffer in ſuch a way.</p>
            <p>He then concluded thus,
<q>The Will of the <hi>Lord</hi> be done, into whoſe Hands I commend my <hi>Spirit;</hi> and truſt that thou, <hi>O moſt merciful Father,</hi> haſt forgiven me all my Tranſgreſſions: The Sins of my Youth, and all the Errors of my paſt Life; and that thou wilt not lay my ſecret Sins to my Charge, but wilt graciouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me, during that ſmall part of my Life now before me; and aſſiſt me in my laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not leave me then to be diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Fear, or any other Temptation; but make the light of thy Countenance to ſhine upon me; For
<hi>thou art my Sun and my Shield:</hi> And as thou ſupporteſt me by thy
<hi>Grace,</hi> ſo I hope thou wilt hereafter crown me with <hi>Glory,</hi> and receive me into the<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59848:97"/>Fellowſhip of <hi>Angels</hi> and
<hi>Saints,</hi> in that bleſſed Inheritance purchaſed for me by my moſt merciful <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who is, I truſt, at thy Right hand, preparing a place for me; <hi>Into whoſe Hands I commend my Spirit.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Indictment,</hi> opened by Mr <hi>Dolben</hi> was to this effect; <hi>That the</hi> Priſoner, <hi>with others, conſpired the death of the</hi> King, <hi>and to levy War in the Kingdom, and ſent one</hi> Aaron Smyth <hi>into</hi> Scotland, <hi>to excite ſome to come from thence, and to conſult upon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to carry on thoſe deſigns; And that</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:59848:98"/>
               <hi>the</hi> Priſoner <hi>to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the</hi> People, <hi>that it was lawful to raiſe</hi> Rebellion; <hi>did cauſe a ſeditious</hi> Libel <hi>to be written, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſions;</hi> That the power is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the People,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note, the Indictment did not charge the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner with publiſhing the Papers, which was ever till <hi>now done,</hi> when Libels have been made Criminal, but their <hi>proof</hi> in this caſe would not come up to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Attorney General</hi> thunders thus againſt him; The <hi>Priſoner</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted of the higheſt Crimes, the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>King's</hi> Death, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the
<hi>Monarchy</hi>—There is no <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> but does believe, that for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years a Deſign was laid; and to that end ſecret Inſtructions were made uſe of, and Libels ſpread, to perſwade the
<hi>People,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> was introducing <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi> (<hi>Ay, ſo he was, and ſo were his Judges, and Council at Law</hi>). that he ſubverted their Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>a ſad truth</hi>) They endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make the World believe the
<hi>King</hi> was a <hi>Papiſt:</hi> (<hi>So they did, and his Dear and Royal Brother, cleared up that Point ſoon after his Death</hi>)—And then
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59848:99"/>there was a Deſign of an open Riſing—This
<hi>Gentleman's</hi> Head and Heart was entire in this Service; he was at this very time preparing a moſt Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and <hi>Trayterous Libel</hi> To perſwade the People, that it is Lawful, nay, that they have a Right, to ſet aſide their <hi>Prince, in caſe it appears that he hath broken the Truſt laid upon him by the People;</hi> He uſes great Reaſon in the Caſe,
<hi>That the Power of the Prince is Originally in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that the King's Power was derived from the People upon Truſt,</hi> (moſt horrid Hereſie) <hi>and they might aſſume the Original Power they had conferred,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Harangue,</hi> to pre-poſſeſs the Jury;
<hi>Mr Weſt, Col. Romſey, and Keel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> were called, and told long Stories of <hi>Conſultations, Plots</hi> and <hi>Reſolutions;</hi> without offering one Word of Evidence againſt <hi>Colonel Sidney.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Lord Howard</hi> told his long Hiſtory of the
<hi>Plot;</hi> that being ended; They gave in Evidence ſome ſcraps of a Manuſcript found in the <hi>Colonel's</hi> Study, and read three or four Paragraphs to the (<hi>judicious</hi>) Jury, whereof I ſhall here give the Reader a touch; <hi>When Pride had changed</hi> Nebuchadnezar <hi>into a Beaſt, what</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:59848:99"/>
               <hi>ſhould perſwade the</hi> Aſſyrians <hi>not to drive him out amongſt Beaſts; until</hi> God
<hi>had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto him the Heart of a Man? When</hi> Tarquin <hi>had turned the Legal</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy <hi>of</hi> Rome, <hi>into a moſt abominable</hi> Tyranny, <hi>Why ſhould they not aboliſh it? And when the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>of the</hi> Low-Countries <hi>were ſo grievouſly oppreſſed by the Power of</hi> Spain, <hi>under the Proud, Cruel and Savage Conduct of the Duke of</hi> Alva; <hi>Why ſhould they not make uſe of all the means that</hi> God <hi>hath put into their Hands, for their Deliverance? Let any Man who ſees the preſent State of the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces <hi>that then united themſelves, judge; whether it is better for them to be, as they are, or in the condition into which his Fury would have reduced them, unleſs they had, to pleaſe him, renounced</hi> God, <hi>and their</hi> Religion:
<hi>Our</hi> Author <hi>may ſay,</hi> They ought to have ſuffered; <hi>The King of</hi> Spain, <hi>by their Reſiſtance, loſt thoſe</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; <hi>and that they ought not to have been</hi> Judges <hi>in their own Caſe. To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That by reſiſting, they laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of many</hi> Churches, <hi>that have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced multitudes of Men, Eminent in Gifts and Graces; and Eſtabliſhed a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and happy</hi> Common-Wealth, <hi>that hath</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:59848:100"/>
               <hi>been ſince its firſt beginning, the ſtrongeſt</hi> Pillar <hi>of the</hi> Proteſtant Cauſe, <hi>now in the World, and a place of Refuge unto thoſe, who in all Parts of</hi> Europe <hi>have been oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the Name of</hi> Chriſt<hi>: Whereas otherwiſe, they had</hi> Slaviſhly, <hi>and I think I may ſay,</hi> Wickedly, <hi>as well as</hi> Fooliſhly;
<hi>ſuffered themſelves to be</hi> Butchered; <hi>they had left thoſe Provinces under the Power of</hi> Anti-Chriſt, <hi>where the Name of</hi> God
<hi>is no otherwiſe known, than to be</hi> Blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the King of</hi> Spain <hi>had deſired to keep his Subjects, He ſhould have Governed them with more Juſtice and Mercy;</hi> When con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Laws, both Humane and Divine, He ſeeks to deſtroy thoſe, He ought to have preſerved, He can blame none but himſelf, if they deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from his Tyranny; <hi>And when the matter is brought to that, That he muſt not Reign, or they over whom he would Reign, muſt periſh, the matter is eaſily decided; As if the Queſtion had been asked in the time of</hi> Nero <hi>or</hi> Domitian, <hi>whether they ſhould be left at Liberty to deſtroy the beſt part of the World, as they endeavoured to do; or it ſhould be reſcued, by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; And as for the</hi> Peoples <hi>being</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:59848:100"/>
               <hi>Judges in their own Caſe, it is plain, they ought to be the only Judges; becauſe it is their own, and only concerns themſelves.</hi>—The general Revolt of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from its own Magiſtrates, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be called Rebellion.</p>
            <p>The Papers being read, <hi>Mr Solicitor</hi> (<hi>doubting ſurely the Capacity of the intelligent Jury to judge of theſe Notions upon the firſt hearing</hi>) ſaid, that no time was miſ-ſpent to make things clear, and that the <hi>Jury</hi> might have the Words read again, if they had a mind to it; and he repeated that offer to them, but the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> better underſtanding the work of the day, then the Treatiſe; did not deſire a repetition of the Words.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Priſoner</hi> here ſaid, <hi>They have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Paper found in my Study of</hi> Domitian <hi>and</hi> Nero; <hi>that is compaſſing the death of the</hi> King, <hi>is it?</hi>—Whatever my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is (of whom I have enough to ſay by and by) <hi>he is but one Witneſs;</hi> and there ought to be two Witneſſes to the ſame thing—Let my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile what he has ſaid now, with what he ſaid at my Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi>'s Tryal if he pleaſes, there he ſwore, he ſaid all he could, and now he has got I know
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59848:101"/>not how many things, that never were ſpoken of there.—He hath accuſed himſelf of divers <hi>Treaſons,</hi> and is under the terror of puniſhment for them; and would get his own Indempnity by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying others—<hi>He owes me a great ſum of Money, and when I ſhould take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, of the forfeit of his</hi> Mortgage, <hi>he finds a way to have me laid up in the</hi> Tower; this is a point of great cunning, at once to get his Pardon and ſave his Money. He was deſirous to go further, and would have got my Servants to put my Plate and Goods into his hands.—He made affirmations in the preſence of <hi>God,</hi> that I was innocent in his opinion, and he was confident of it; I know in my Lord
<hi>Ruſſell</hi>'s Caſe, Dr <hi>Burnet</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſomething like this; and when my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> came to anſwer it; he ſaid <hi>he was to face it out:</hi> Now he did face it out bravely againſt <hi>God,</hi> but was very timerous of Man—I am to give an account of theſe Papers, which they would piece and patch to my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s diſcourſe, and by a ſtrange kind of conſtruction and imagination, make to have relation to this <hi>PLOT,</hi> as they call it (I know of none.)
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59848:101"/>They offer no proof but ſimilitude of Hands<hi>:</hi> Some years ago, the Lady <hi>Car</hi> was indicted of <hi>Perjury;</hi> and as evidence, ſome Letters of hers were produced, that were contrary to what ſhe ſwore in <hi>Chancery;</hi> and it was proved to be like her hand; but Chief <hi>Juſtice Keeling</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Jury, that this was the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and leaſt of proofs, in Civil Cauſes; but in
<hi>Criminal</hi> it was none at all; So that my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Teſtimony is ſingle—As to the Conſult he talks of, What could ſix Men do? Can my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> raiſe five Men by his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit? By his Purſe? For my part I knew not where to raiſe five Men. That ſuch Men as We are, that have no Followers, ſhould undertake ſo vaſt a deſign, is very unlikely; And <hi>this great deſign thus carried on, had neither</hi> Officers <hi>nor</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>no Place, no Time, no Money for it.</hi> This is a pritty <hi>Cabal,</hi> and a very deep maintaining of the
<hi>Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Priſoner</hi> called the Earl of
<hi>Angleſey,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Clare,</hi> Capt <hi>Philip Howard, Dr Burnet,</hi> Mr <hi>Joſeph Ducas,</hi> Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and Mr <hi>Edward Howard;</hi> who all teſtified that the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> had frequently with great aſſeverations,<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59848:102"/>and calling <hi>God</hi> to Witneſs, <hi>affirmed that he knew of no Plot, and that he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of</hi> Colonel Sidney's <hi>Innocence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Blake</hi> proved, that my Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> told him,
<hi>that he could not get his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, till he had paſt the drudgery of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Ducas, Grace Tracy</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Penwick,</hi> proved, that the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> came to the <hi>Colonel's</hi> Houſe, and being told that he was taken away to the Tower for the Plot, He took
<hi>God</hi> to witneſs, he knew nothing of it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the
<hi>Colonel</hi> did not; <hi>and he then deſired that the</hi> Colonel's
<hi>Plate and Goods might be ſent to his Houſe to be ſecured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr <hi>Wharton offered to imitate thoſe Sheets of paper, ſo that they ſhould not know which was which;</hi> but the Court did not regard it.</p>
            <p>Now Mr <hi>Solicitor,</hi> in his wonted luxuriant way of talking Men to Death, falls upon the Priſoner, and jumbles things thus together, (<hi>in his Addreſs to the Jury) Gentlemen!</hi> We go about to prove the compaſſing and imagining the Death of the <hi>King,</hi> by the Priſoner's conſulting how to raiſe Armes; and by plain matter in writing under his hand;<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59848:102"/>
               <hi>where he does affirm, it is lawful to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and deſtroy the King</hi> [A ſtrange Suggeſtion, no way warranted by the reading the Papers] and he then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the ſame way to inſinuate many things againſt the Priſoner, which no way affected nor reached him, by the Evidence given. He then comes to the Papers, and ſayes,
<hi>Compaſſing and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Death of the King, is the Act of the mind,</hi> and when once there is an <hi>Overt Act,</hi> that is, a thing that manifeſts ſuch intention; Then the Law takes hold of it: Now after this Evidence. [<hi>which the Reader will remember was only the Lord Howard's Swearing</hi>] I think no Man will doubt, whether it was in the heart of the Priſoner to deſtroy the <hi>King;</hi> here is an avowed principle of
<hi>Rebellion,</hi> Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht, upon the ſtrongeſt reaſon he has to back it—Gentlemen<hi>!</hi> [<hi>ſpeaking to the Carpenter and his Fellows, moſt compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges of ſuch a Book</hi>] <hi>This,</hi> with the other Evidence that has been given, <hi>will be ſufficient to prove his compaſſing the Death of the</hi> King—<hi>This Book is another, and more than two Witneſſes againſt him;</hi> you have heard one Witneſs prove it poſitively to you, that he conſulted to<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59848:103"/>riſe in Arms againſt the <hi>King,</hi> and here is his own Book ſays, <hi>it is lawful to riſe in Arms, if the King break his Truſt,</hi> and in effect he has ſaid the <hi>King</hi> has broken his Truſt, therefore, <hi>this will be a ſufficient demonſtration, what the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart of this Man was; that it was nothing but the Deſtruction of the</hi> King <hi>and of the</hi> Government—Some Men, may by paſſion, be tranſported into ſuch an offence; in them, it is leſs dangerous, but it is this <hi>Gentleman's</hi> principle;
<hi>Gentlemen!</hi> This is the more dangerons <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> in this Man, by how much the more it is rooted in him; and how deep it is you hear, when a Man ſhall write as his principle, <hi>that it is lawful to depoſe Kings, they breaking their Truſt; and that the Revolt of the whole Nation cannot be called Rebellion.</hi> It will be a very <hi>ſad</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">But late Experience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes his Opinion, and we now ſee 'tis a very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Caſe.</note> 
               <hi>Caſe, when People act this, according to their Conſciences;</hi> and do all this for the good of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as they would have it thought; but this is the Principle of this Man, <hi>We think We have plainly made it out, that is</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:59848:103"/>
               <hi>was the Imagination of his heart to Deſtroy the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> ſaid, My <hi>Lord,</hi> We have had a long ſtory, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> Mr Solicitor <hi>would not think it his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to take away Mens Lives any how</hi>—My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> and Lord <hi>Hales,</hi> were both of Opinion, That the <hi>Overt Act</hi> of one
<hi>Treaſon,</hi> is not an <hi>Overt Act</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Hales</hi> ſaith, <hi>Compaſſing by bare words is not an Overt Act; Conſpiring to levy VVar is no Overt Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> concluded, with a long Repetition, of what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended had been given in Evidence? and ſaid, that though ſome <hi>Judges</hi> had been of opinion; that <hi>Words</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were not an <hi>Overt Act;</hi> yet my <hi>Lord Hales</hi> nor my <hi>Lord Coke,</hi> nor any other of the <hi>Sages</hi> of the Law, ever queſtioned, but that a Letter would be an <hi>Overt Act,</hi> ſufficient to prove a Man guilty of <hi>Treaſon;</hi> for <hi>Scribere eſt Agere.</hi>—Gentlemen<hi>!</hi> I muſt tell you, that in Caſe there be but one Witneſs to prove a direct <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and another to prove a circumſtance, that contributes to that <hi>Treaſon;</hi> That will make two <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to prove the <hi>Treaſon</hi>—Here
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59848:104"/>is a <hi>moſt trayterous Lybel,</hi> if you believe that <hi>Colonel Sidney</hi> writ it; No Man can doubt but it is a ſufficient Evidence, that he is guilty of Compaſſing and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the Death of the
<hi>King</hi>—I muſt mind you that <hi>this Book contains all the Malice, and Revenge, and Treaſon, that Mankind can be guilty of.</hi>—This is made uſe of by him to ſtir up the <hi>People</hi> to
<hi>Rebellion</hi> [<hi>yet by the way it was not ſo much as pretended that</hi> Colonel Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <hi>had publiſhed the Book, or ſhown it to any Mortal</hi>]—So 'tis not upon two, but upon greater Evidence then two and twenty; if you believe this <hi>Book</hi> was writ by him. Next I muſt tell you, upon, I think, a leſs Evidence, the <hi>Lord Ruſſel</hi> was Convicted and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, [<hi>An excellent Argument, that having then taſted Noble Blood, they muſt go on to drink their fill of it; 'tis to be lamented, that ſuch Miſcreants have not been diſmiſſed the World, as the famous</hi> Scythian Queen To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myris, <hi>did the</hi> Perſian <hi>Tyrant</hi> with a <hi>Satiate vos Sanguine, quem ſitiſtis, Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores Patriae et dedecus humani generis.</hi>]</p>
            <p>This Doctrine thus powerfully inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the well diſpoſed <hi>Jury,</hi> (<hi>a pack of meer Tools, to eccho back the pleaſure of the</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:59848:104"/>
               <hi>Judge</hi>) procured a Guilty to be without difficulty brought in, upon this <hi>Great and Noble Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It being hereupon demanded of him, what he had to ſay why Judgment of Death ſhould not be given againſt him, He ſaid, that he had had no Tryal, <hi>he was to be Tryed by his Country,</hi> and he did not find his <hi>Country</hi> in the <hi>Jury</hi> that tryed him; There were ſome of them that were not <hi>Freeholders;</hi> and there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law nor Preſident of any Man <hi>Tryed by a Jury,</hi> in a <hi>County;</hi> that were not <hi>Freeholders;</hi> So he had had no Tryal at all, and if ſo, there could be no <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>Jefferies</hi> replyed, that he had had the Opinion of the Court in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that they were unanimous in it. (<hi>And ſo they were in all murdering work at that day.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Colonel Sidney <hi>then ſaid, that there was nothing of Treaſon in the Words,</hi> ſaid to be written in the Papers if the nature of the thing were examined; To which the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> retorted, There is not a line in the Book ſcarce, but what is <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sentence being paſſed, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner expreſſed himſelf in theſe Words;<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59848:105"/>
               <hi>Why then, O Lord, Sanctifie I beſeech thee theſe my Sufferings unto me, Sanctifie me through my Sufferings, Sanctifie me through thy Truth, Thy Word is Truth; Impute not my Blood unto this Nation, Impute it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the grand City, through which I ſhall be led unto the place of Death; Let not my Soul cry, tho' it lies under the Altar; make not Inquiſition for my Blood, or if innocent</hi> Blood

            <p>Upon the 7th of <hi>December,</hi> 1683. He was Beheaded upon

                           <hi>We live in an Age, that maketh Truth paſs for Treaſon;</hi> I dare not ſay any thing contrary to Truth, and the
<note n="*" place="margin">Sheriff <hi>Daniel</hi>'s, &amp;c.</note> Ears of thoſe that are about me, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be found too tender to hear it.</p>

                           <hi>Weſt, Romſey</hi> and <hi>Keeling,</hi> brought to prove the <hi>Plot,</hi> ſaid no more of me,<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59848:105"/>than that they did not know me. The Lord <hi>Howard is too infamous</hi> by his Life, and his many <hi>Perjuries,</hi> not to be denyed, or rather ſworn by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeif,
<hi>to deſerve mention:</hi> and being a ſingle Witneſs, would be of no value, though he had been of unblemiſhed Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, or had not ſeen and confeſſed, <hi>that the Crimes committed by him, would be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, only for committing more.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This being laid aſide, the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is reduced to the Papers ſaid to be found in my Cloſet—If I had been ſeen to write them, the matter would not be much altered; They plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to relate unto a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> written long ſince in anſwer to
<hi>Filmer</hi>'s <hi>Book, which is grounded upon wicked Principles, equally pernicious to Magiſtrates and People.</hi>

                        <p>If he might publiſh unto the World, his Opinion,
<hi>that all</hi> Men <hi>are born under a neceſſity, derived from the</hi> Laws <hi>of</hi> God <hi>and</hi> Nature, <hi>to ſubmit unto an abſolute</hi> Kingly Government, <hi>which could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by no Law, or Oath; and that he that hath the Power, hath the Right, and the Perſons and Eſtates of his Subjects, muſt be indiſpenſably ſubject to it;</hi> I know not, why I might not have publiſhed my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59848:106"/>to the contrary, without the breach of any <hi>Law.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>That</hi> Magiſtrates <hi>were ſet up for the good of Nations, not Nations for the honour or glory of</hi> Magiſtrates.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That the Right and Power of Magiſtrates was that which the Laws of the Country made it to be.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That thoſe Laws were to be obſerved; and the Oaths taken by them; having the force of a Contract between Magiſtrate and People, could not be violated without danger of diſſolving the whole Fabrick.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That few would be ſo gentle, as to ſpare even the beſt</hi> Magiſtrates, <hi>if by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, a wild</hi> Uſurper, <hi>could become</hi> God's Anointed.</p>
                        <p>This ſeems to agree, with the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> of the moſt <hi>Reverend Authors,</hi> of all <hi>Times, Nations</hi> and
<hi>Religions.</hi> The beſt and wiſeſt of <hi>Kings</hi> have ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it. <hi>King James,</hi> in his Speech to the
<hi>Parliament,</hi> Anno 1603, <hi>doth, in the higheſt degree, aſſert it; The</hi> Scripture <hi>ſeems to declare it.</hi> If the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59848:106"/>Writer nevertheleſs, was miſtaken, <hi>No Man, for ſuch matters, hath ever been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Judgment of a</hi> Jury,
<hi>compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Men, utterly unable to comprehend them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But there was little of this in my Caſe; The
<hi>extravagance</hi> of my <hi>Proſecutors</hi> goes higher; The Treatiſe was never finiſhed, nor could be in many Years; So much as is of it, was written long ſince; never reviewed, nor ſhewn to any Man.</p>
                        <p>Whatſoever is ſaid of the <hi>expulſion</hi> of
<hi>Tarquin;</hi> The <hi>Inſurrection</hi> of <hi>Nero;</hi> The
<hi>Slaughter</hi> of <hi>Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Domitian,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is applied by Innuendo unto the King.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They have not conſidered, that <hi>if ſuch</hi> Acts

<hi>would have adviſed with the</hi> King's Councel, <hi>of the means of bringing a man to death, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a</hi> Jury <hi>to be pack'd, by the</hi> King's Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>and the</hi> Under-Sheriff: <hi>Admit of</hi> Jury Men,
<hi>who are not</hi> Freeholders; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch evidence, as is above mentioned; refuſe a Copy of an</hi> Indictment, or to ſuffer the Statute of
46 <hi>Edward</hi> 3. to be read, that doth enact, <hi>It ſhould, in no caſe, be denied unto any Man upon any occaſion whatſoever; over-rule the moſt important points of Law without hearing.</hi> And, whereas the
<hi>Statute</hi> 25 <hi>Edward</hi> 3. upon which they ſaid, I ſhould be tryed, <hi>doth reſerve unto the</hi> Parliament <hi>all</hi> Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <hi>to be made, in point of</hi> Treaſon. <hi>They could aſſume unto themſelves, not only a power to make</hi> Conſtructions;
<hi>but ſuch</hi> Conſtructions, <hi>as neither agree with</hi> Law, Reaſon, <hi>or</hi> Common Senſe.</p>
                        <p>By theſe means, I am brought to this place; The
<hi>Lord</hi> forgive theſe Practices, and avert the Evils, that threaten the Nation from them; <hi>The Lord ſanctifie theſe my Sufferings unto me, and tho' I fall, as a</hi> Sacrifice <hi>unto</hi> Idols; <hi>ſuffer not</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry <hi>to be eſtabliſhed in this</hi> Land. <hi>Bleſs thy People and ſave them, defend thy own</hi>
                           <pb n="205" facs="tcp:59848:107"/>Cauſe, <hi>and defend thoſe that defend it. Stir up ſuch as are ſaint: direct thoſe that are willing: Confirm thoſe that waver: Give Wiſdom and Integrity unto all. Order all things ſo as may moſt redound to thy own Glory. Grant, that I may dye glorifying Thee, for all thy Mercies, and, that at the laſt, thou haſt permitted me to be ſingled out, as a</hi> Witneſs <hi>of thy</hi> Truth; <hi>and even by the Confeſſion of my</hi> Oppoſers, for that old C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>This great Man, having in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Paper, mentioned the <hi>Opinion</hi> of <hi>King James,</hi> the firſt delivered in his <hi>Speech</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the Year 1603. I ſhall here, to gratifie the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Curioſity, tranſcribe a Paragraph or two of that Learned <hi>King's</hi> Speech (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I do acknowledge, that the ſpecial and greateſt point of difference, that is betwixt a rightful</hi> King, <hi>and an uſurping</hi> Tyrant, <hi>is</hi>
                           <pb n="206" facs="tcp:59848:108"/>
                           <hi>in this: That: whereas the proud and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious</hi> Tyrant, <hi>doth think his</hi> Kingdom
<hi>and</hi> People, <hi>are only ordained, for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his Deſires &amp; unreaſonable Appetites; The righteous and juſt</hi> King
<hi>doth, on the contrary, acknowledge himſelf to be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the procuring of the Wealth and Proſperity of his</hi> People; <hi>and that his great and principal Worldly Felicity, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their Proſperity.</hi>—That I am a Servant, it is moſt true; <hi>That as I am Head and Governour of all the People in my Dominion,</hi> who are my
<hi>natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, conſidering them in diſtinct Ranks;</hi> So, if we will take in the <hi>People</hi> as one <hi>Body,</hi> Then, as the
<hi>Head</hi> is ordained for the <hi>Body,</hi> and not the <hi>Body</hi> for the <hi>Head;</hi> ſo, muſt a righteous <hi>King,</hi> know himſelf to be ordained for his <hi>People,</hi> and not his <hi>People</hi> for him.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, <hi>I will never be aſhamed to sonfeſs it my principal honour, to be the</hi> great Servant of the Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p>To this I ſhall ſubjoyn a few Words, to the ſame purpoſe, out of that <hi>King</hi>'s Speech to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> in
1609</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Every just</hi> King <hi>in a ſettled</hi> Kingdom,
<hi>is bound to obſerve that Paction made to his People, by his Laws; in framing his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                           <pb n="207" facs="tcp:59848:108"/>
                           <hi>agreeable thereunto; And therefore,</hi> a <hi>King,</hi> governing in a ſettled Kingdom, ceaſes to be a King, and degenerates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Tyrant, as ſoon as he leaves off, to rule according to the Laws.</hi>

            <head>Notes upon the Tryal of Sr <hi>Samuel Barnardiſton</hi> Baronet, at <hi>Guild-Hall London,</hi> Before Sr <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the King's Bench, upon the 14<hi>th</hi> day of
<hi>February,</hi> 1683. upon an <hi>Information</hi> to the effect follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</head>
            <p>THat there having been a <hi>Horrid Plot</hi> lately diſcovered, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, to ſcandalize the Evidence, wrote a Letter to this effect,
<hi>viz. That the return of the</hi> Duke of Monmouth <hi>and his being received into Favour with the</hi> King, <hi>had made a great alteration at Court,</hi> and that thoſe who before ſpoke indecently of him, did now court and creep to him; Yeſterday, being the laſt of the <hi>Term,</hi> all the Priſoners in the<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59848:109"/>
               <hi>Tower,</hi> upon the late

<hi>Bavddon</hi> (<hi>who Proſecuted the Murder of the Earl of Eſſex</hi>) for a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornation, was not proſecuted, and his Bail was diſcharged, and the paſſing Sentence upon the <hi>Author</hi> of
<hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> and the <hi>Printer</hi> of the late
<hi>Lord Ruſſel's Speech,</hi> was paſſed over with ſilence; Great Applications are made to the <hi>King,</hi> for the pardoning Mr
<hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>—The <hi>Lord Howard</hi> appears deſpicable, in the eyes of all men—The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>high Tories</hi> are quite down in the Mouth, <hi>Their Pride is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and themſelves and their Plot confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but their Malice is not Aſſwaged.</hi> Its generally ſaid, the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> was Murdered.

<hi>and</hi> Abhorrers. And that he wrote in another Letter to this effect. The
<hi>King</hi> is never pleaſed but when the <hi>Duke of Monmouth</hi> is with him—His Pardon was Sealed and delivered to him laſt Wedneſday; 'tis ſaid he will be reſtored to be Maſter of the Horſe,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>—He treats all his<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59848:109"/>old Friends with great Civility, they are all ſatisfied with his Integrity, and if
<hi>God</hi> ſpare his Life, doubt not but he will be an Inſtrument of much good, to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom;</hi> he ſaid publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he knew my <hi>Lord Ruſſel was as Loyal a Subject as any in</hi> England; and that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> believ'd the ſame now; it would make you laugh, to ſee how ſtrangely our high <hi>Torys</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> are mortified, their Countenances ſpeak it—Sr <hi>George</hi> is grown very humble<hi>:</hi> Its ſaid Mr <hi>Sidney</hi> is reprieved for forty days, which bodes well.</p>
            <p>And that in a third <hi>Letter</hi> he wrote thus, The late change here in publick Affairs, is ſo great and ſtrange that we are like men in a Dream, and fear we are not fit for ſo great a Mercy as the preſent Juncture ſeems to promiſe; the <hi>Sham Proteſtant Plot</hi> is quite loſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
            <p>And that in a fourth <hi>Letter,</hi> there are theſe expreſſions—Contrary to all mens expectations, a <hi>Warrant</hi> is ſigned for beheading <hi>Colonel Sidney</hi> at <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> next
<hi>Fryday;</hi> great endeavours have been uſed to obtain this Pardon,

<hi>Jury,</hi> that he ſuppoſed they would not take it upon their Oaths, that he was guilty of what he was there accuſed of, many things being laid in the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to inhanſe the Crime, of which there was no proof.</p>
            <p>The Clamorous <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59848:111"/>to dierct the <hi>Jury,</hi> expreſſed himſelf to this effect, That the <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> took notice of a horrid Conſpiracy lately hatcht, for the deſtruction of the <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>ſubverſion of the Government;</hi> and that the <hi>Lord Ruſſell</hi> and <hi>Algernon Sidney,</hi> who were ingaged in that
<hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Conſpiracy,</hi> were convicted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Defendant,</hi> being <hi>diſſaffected</hi> and a man of <hi>ill Principles;</hi> to diſturb the Government, did cauſe the four Letters to be writ and publiſhed.</p>
            <p>That the Letters were Factious, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and Malitious; and as baſe as the worſt of mankind could have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented—That it was a work of time and thought, fixt in his very Nature; and ſhewed ſo much Venom, as would make one think the whole maſs of his Blood were corrupted.</p>
            <p>Here is <hi>malice</hi> againſt the <hi>King,</hi> malice againſt the <hi>Government,</hi> malice againſt both <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>State,</hi> malice againſt any man that bears any ſhare in the
<hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> indeed malice againſt all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that are not of the ſame perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with thoſe <hi>bloody Miſcreants—Here is the ſanctifying of</hi> Traytors <hi>juſtly</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:59848:111"/>
               <hi>executed—Here is the Sainting of two horrid</hi> Conſpirators, the Lord <hi>Ruſſell that bleſſed</hi> Martyr; <hi>my Lord</hi> Ruſſell <hi>that good man, that excellent Proteſtant,</hi> he is lamented; and here is Mr <hi>Sidney</hi> Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what an extraordinary man was he—<hi>'tis a ſhame to think that ſuch</hi> bloody Miſcreants <hi>ſhould be Sainted and lamented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis high time for all mankind that have any
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or ſenſe of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> or <hi>Hell</hi> to beſtir themſelves, to rid the Nation of ſuch <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> ſuch <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Villany,</hi> as theſe are.</p>
            <p>Theſe Letters tell you, God <hi>would be ſure to raiſe up Inſtruments;</hi> but what <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi> do they mean?
<hi>Inſtruments</hi> of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Faction and Sedition;</hi> which they moſt falſly call his own Work.</p>
            <p>The queſtion is, whether the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> be guilty of writing theſe <hi>Venomous, Malicious, Seditious, Factious, Tumultuous Letters,</hi> of which you have as full and plain proof as can be made; And as to his publiſhing them, can you think that he would write all this Malitious Stuff, to put them in his Pocket; but you have it ſworn, that the
<hi>Defendant</hi> ſaid they were ſent to the <hi>Poſt-Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59848:112"/>Then, the <hi>Jury</hi> immediately gave in their Verdict, that the Defendant was Guilty of the Offence and Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, charged in the <hi>Indictment; as no doubt they reſolved to do, before they heard one word of the matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Judgment</hi> upon this <hi>Verdict,</hi> was, that the
<hi>Defendant ſhould pay</hi> 10000 <hi>l Fine, and be Impriſoned till paid, and to find Sureties for the good Behaviour for Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, he was committed for the Fine, to the <hi>King</hi>'s
<hi>Bench,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a <hi>Priſoner</hi> four or five years, which ſatisfied not, but <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> thoſe Inſtruments of Rapine and Oppreſſion, broke in upon his Eſtate, and beſides the

            <head>Notes upon the Proceedings againſt Sr <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> at the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> the 14<hi>th</hi> of

            </head>
            <p>SR <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> having been <hi>Out-lawed,</hi> upon an <hi>Indictment</hi> of <hi>high Treaſon,</hi> and betrayed, and brought from <hi>Holland;</hi> was Committed to <hi>New-gate</hi> upon the
10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1684. by the <hi>Warrant</hi> of <hi>Sidney Goldolphin</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
               <hi>principal Secretary</hi> of State; And upon the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> being brought to the <hi>King's Bench</hi> Bar; Sr <hi>Robert Sawyer</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney General, moved the Court for an award of <hi>Execution,</hi> upon the <hi>Outlawry;</hi> Whereupon he was Arraigned on the <hi>Outlawry (viz.) that he had been Indicted of</hi> high Treaſon <hi>for conſpiring againſt the</hi> King's Life, and the
<hi>Government;</hi> That for not appearing to plead and try that
<hi>Indictment,</hi> he ſtood <hi>Outlawed,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Attainted of the <hi>Treaſon;</hi> And it was demanded of him, what he had to ſay,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59848:113"/>why Execution ſhould not be awarded againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr Thomas</hi> urged, <hi>that he was beyond Sea at the time of the</hi> Outlawry, and deſired that he might be Tryed; To which the
<hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> anſwered, <hi>We have nothing to do, but to award Execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sr <hi>Thomas</hi> deſired that the <hi>Statute</hi> 6.
<hi>Edward</hi> 6. might be read, <hi>which gives the Perſon Outlawed for</hi> Treaſon, <hi>a year to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe it, if he were beyond Sea;</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that Counſel might be aſſigned him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ordered the <hi>Statute</hi> to be read, to which the <hi>Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> aſſented, but ſaid Sr
<hi>Thomas</hi> would not find it to his purpoſe; it was read to this effect,
<hi>That all proceſs of</hi> Outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>for</hi> Treaſon <hi>againſt Offenders, being beyond the Seas, ſhall be effectual in the Law, but it provides that if the Party ſhall within a year, yield himſelf to the</hi> Chief Juſtice, <hi>and offer to traverſe the</hi> Indictment, <hi>he ſhall be received to traverſe, and being found not Guilty, he ſhall be acquitted of the</hi> Outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>and of all Penalties and Forfeitures by reaſon thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Attorney General</hi> ſaid, Sr <hi>Thomas,</hi> now I ſuppoſe will ſhew he<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59848:113"/>yielded himſelf to your
<hi>Lordſhip;</hi> and added, that before he went out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> he might have rendred himſelf, and been Tryed if he had pleaſed.</p>
            <p>Sr <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> anſwered, I have been a
<hi>Priſoner;</hi> the year is not yet out, I now render my ſelf, and do conceive I am within the Benefit of the <hi>Statute,</hi> and do deſire it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> replyed, we are of another opinion, we cannot take notice of it, <hi>there is no doubt nor difficulty at all in the thing,</hi> and applying to <hi>Richardſon,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Captain Richardſon, you ſhall have a rule for Execution on Friday next.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, Sr <hi>Thomas</hi> offered to the <hi>Court,</hi> that one in that place had the benefit of a Tryal offered him, and that was it that he deſired, for he thanked <hi>God</hi> his Caſe was quite another then his. That he knew his own Innocence, (<hi>And ſo did They too, otherwiſe he had not been denyed a Tryal.</hi>) and deſired to make it appear by a Tryal.</p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> anſwered, that which you ſpeak of, was the <hi>Grace and Mercy of</hi> King, who may, if he pleaſe extend the ſame to you; but we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that according to Law, we muſt<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59848:114"/>award Execution upon this <hi>Outlawry.</hi> Thereupon Mrs <hi>Mathews</hi> Sr <hi>Thomas's</hi> Daughter ſaid, <hi>My Lord, I hope you will not Murder my Father;</hi> for which being Brow-beaten and checkt, ſhe added, <hi>God Almighty</hi>'s <hi>Judgments light upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Attorney General</hi> ſaid, that he would acquaint the <hi>Court</hi> with one thing, in reference to what Sr <hi>Thomas</hi> had ſaid, That the <hi>King</hi> did indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge <hi>Holloway</hi> ſo far, as to offer him a Tryal, and perhaps might have ſome reaſon for it; but affirmed, that the <hi>Priſoner deſerved no ſort of Indulgence or Mercy;</hi> and then, in effect went on to give Evidence againſt him, ſaying, <hi>that it appeared that after the diſappointment to the meeting at the</hi> Rye, <hi>by the</hi> New-market fire, <hi>Sr Thomas was one of thoſe, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to deſtroy the</hi> King <hi>by the way,</hi> upon his haſty coming then to Town; and affirmed, that this did appear upon a full and clear Evidence; and that when he was taken beyond Sea, Letters of Communication with <hi>Foreign Miniſters</hi> and other people, were found about him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> (knowing a more expeditious way of murdering this<pb facs="tcp:59848:114"/>
               <hi>Gentleman</hi>) ſaid he would not meddle with evidence; telling the <hi>Attorney,</hi> that that was not their buſineſs (<hi>and no doubt they were both conſcious that they had not evidence where with to convict him</hi>) and ſaid, we have nothing more to do, but to award
<hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sr <hi>Thomas</hi> ſtill inſiſted that he was within the
<hi>Statute,</hi> that <hi>he was Out-lawed while he was beyond Sea, and that the twelve Moneths not being paſt, he ought to have the Law,</hi> and demanded no more. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the <hi>Bloody-Monſter,</hi> in a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and inhumane manner, concluded thus; That you ſhall have, by the
<hi>Grace of God;</hi> ſee that execution be done on <hi>Friday</hi> next, according to Law. <hi>You ſhall have the full benefit of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may ſeem proper in this place, to note to the
<hi>Reader,</hi> the reaſon why the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> (as termed by the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Attorney General</hi>) of being admitted to Tryal, was offered to <hi>Holloway</hi> upon the one and twentieth of <hi>April</hi> before; and now denyed to Sr <hi>Thomas Armſtrong;</hi> which cannot be better done, then by caſting an Eye to the proceedings upon
<hi>Holloway;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it manifeſtly appears, that that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59848:115"/>perſon, had been wrought upon, by the fear of Death and hope of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to be very prodigal in his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it being moſt evident, that what he had declared, was more then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Witneſſes againſt himſelf; and that he had put down a multitude of Hear-ſays and Reports of others; the truth whereof, never did nor will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; Hereupon, they who had before wheedled &amp; deluded him, do now careſs him; Mr
<hi>Attorney</hi> told him, that at Law he was gone, but if he had any thing to ſay to defend himſelf, the <hi>King</hi> would not exclude him, but
<hi>extend his Mercy ſo far, as to admit him to Tryal.</hi> Upon which the
<hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, <hi>Mr Attorney, it is exceeding well;</hi> and told the <hi>Priſoner</hi> that the <hi>King was pleaſed to ſignifie his gratious Intention towards him, in that he was contented to wave the</hi> Out-lawry, <hi>and allow him to try the matter, if he thought he could defend himſelf.</hi> The <hi>Priſoner</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſnared, and that this <hi>Grace</hi> would ſerve him, as it did all others that fell into their power at that time; did only anſwer, that he could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to defend himſelf, he <hi>having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thrown himſelf upon the</hi> King's
<hi>mercy,</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:59848:115"/>
               <hi>and confeſſed himſelf guilty of many things in the Indictment.</hi> So he was ſentenced, and <hi>dyed without Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the place of Execution Sr <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> deported himſelf with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, becoming a great man, and with the Seriouſneſs and Piety ſuitable to a very good <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sheriff Daniel</hi> told him, that he had leave to ſay what he pleaſed, and ſhould not be interrupted, <hi>unleſs he upbraided the Government;</hi> Sr <hi>Thomas</hi> thereupon told him, that he ſhould not ſay any thing by way of <hi>Speech;</hi> but delivered him a Paper, which he ſaid contained his mind, he then called for Dr <hi>Tenniſon</hi> who prayed with him, and then he prayed himſelf.</p>
            <p>In his Paper he thus expreſſed himſelf, <hi>That he thanked</hi> Almighty God, <hi>he found himſelf prepared for Death, his thoughts ſet upon another World, and weaned from this; yet he could not but give ſo much of his little time as to anſwer ſome</hi> Calumnies, <hi>and particularly what</hi> Mr Attorney <hi>accuſed him of at the</hi> Bar;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he prayed to be allowed a</hi> Tryal <hi>for his Life,</hi> according to the Laws of the Land, <hi>and urged the</hi> Statute of
<hi>Edw.</hi> 6.<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59848:116"/>
               <hi>which was expreſly for it; but it ſignified nothing, and he was with an extraordinary Roughneſs condemned and made a precedent;</hi> tho' <hi>Holloway</hi> had it offered him, and he could not but think all the world would conclude his caſe very different, elſe why refuſed to him?</p>
            <p>That Mr <hi>Attorney</hi> charged him for being one of thoſe that was to kill the <hi>King, He took</hi> God <hi>to witneſs, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a thought to take away the</hi> King's <hi>Life, and that no man ever had the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to propoſe ſo barbarous and baſe a thing to him; and that he never was in any deſign to alter the</hi> Government.</p>
            <p>That if he had been tryed, he could have proved the Lord
<hi>Howard</hi>'s baſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon him, to be notoriouſly falſe—He concluded, that he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and now dyed of the <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the
<hi>Church of</hi> England, <hi>and he heartily wiſhed he had lived more ſtrictly up to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he believed:</hi> That he had found the great comfort of the Love and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>God,</hi> in and through his
<hi>bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> in whom he only truſted, and verily hoped that he was going to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that fulneſs of Joy which is in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59848:116"/>his preſence, the hopes whereof infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed him. He thanked <hi>God</hi> he had no repining, but chearfully ſubmitted to the puniſhment of his Sins; He free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgave all the World, even thoſe concerned in taking away his Life, <hi>tho' he could not but think his Sentence very hard, he being denyed the Laws of the Land.</hi>

            <p>THat Mr <hi>Papillon</hi> was ſecond to none in his zealous and undaunted op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to the wicked attempts of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> is very well known; and deſerves to be for ever remembred with honour; None out did him in a diligent and faithful diſcharge of his Truſt in ſeveral <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1681, there appeared a <hi>Race</hi> of Men, fond of
<hi>Vaſſalage</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> to that degree, that they made
<hi>Addreſſes of Thanks to the</hi> King, <hi>for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two</hi> Parliaments, <hi>in the compaſs of three Months;</hi> meerly upon the ſcore of their ſteady Reſolution, to extirpate the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot</hi> and

               <hi>Addreſſes, with promiſe of venturing their Lives and Fortunes,</hi> to maintain this Violation of the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the
<hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> having been preſented to the <hi>King</hi> by Sr
<hi>William Pritchard,</hi> Sr <hi>George Jefferies</hi> and others; Mr
<hi>Papillon,</hi> in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of it, promoted and perſonally proſecuted a <hi>Petition</hi> to the <hi>Lord Mayor, Aldermen,</hi> and
<hi>Common-Council;</hi> praying, <hi>that the Thanks of the City might be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to</hi> Sr Robert Clayton, Sr Thomas Player, Alderman Pilkington and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman Love, <hi>their worthy and well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> Repreſentatives
<hi>in the</hi> Oxford Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and ſhewing, <hi>That as matters then ſtood, the</hi> Papiſts, <hi>being animated in their Bloody deſigns,</hi> by the hopes of a Popiſh Succeſſor; <hi>a Declaration to have frequent</hi> Parliaments, <hi>could not attribute to the ſafety of the</hi> Kingdom, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the minds of <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> but that
<hi>it must be the ſitting of a</hi> Parliament, <hi>ſo as to ſearch the</hi> Plot <hi>to the bottom; to Proſecute the</hi> Conſpirators,
<hi>and provide ſuitable Laws, againſt the impending</hi> Evils; and that nothing elſe could be effectual. Further,</p>
            <p>This <hi>Gentleman,</hi> having in the ſame year, 1681. greatly added to his guilt,<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59848:120"/>by baffling the <hi>Popiſh</hi> deſigns, upon the <hi>Lives, Liberties and Eſtates</hi> of all
<hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> in <hi>the attempt upon the</hi> Earl of Shaftesbury; He exerts himſelf in the year 1682. in the defence of the great and undoubted Right of the <hi>Citizens,</hi> to chuſe their own <hi>Sheriffs;</hi> but now, <hi>arbitrary Power</hi> being, by the aid of <hi>ill Men,</hi> become rampant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable, <hi>he muſt be ſacrificed to their Revenge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Papillon</hi> having been duly elected one of the
<hi>Sheriffs</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex;</hi> he brought a Writ of <hi>Mandamus</hi> out of the Court of <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> to command the <hi>Mayor</hi> &amp; <hi>Aldermen</hi> to ſwear him into the

            </p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Attorney General</hi> told the <hi>Jury,</hi> that
<hi>the action was brought to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the honour of the</hi> Chair, <hi>from ſuch Affronts, as theſe,</hi> which in no Age (till our times of

<hi>againſt the Lives of the</hi> King <hi>and the</hi> Duke; <hi>and for ſubverſion of the</hi> Government—The end of this buſineſs was, to have had a commotion, for the accompliſhing their great
<hi>Conſpiracy;</hi> but <hi>Parturiunt Montes,</hi> For after this Tragical Out-cry, their own <hi>Witneſſes</hi> only proved, that <hi>Mr</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:59848:121"/>
               <hi>Brome</hi> the <hi>Coroner,</hi> went to my <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> and told him that he had a <hi>Writ</hi> againſt him, at the ſuite of Mr <hi>Papillon,</hi> and another at the Suite of <hi>Mr Dubois;</hi> and prayed him, that he would pleaſe to give an appearance, and that upon his refuſing to do it, his Lordſhip went in his own
<hi>Coach</hi> to the <hi>Coroner's</hi> Houſe.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Serjeant Maynard,</hi> then offered to the <hi>Jury, That my</hi> Lord Mayor, <hi>if he miſtake in his Office, and doth not that which belongs to him to do, he is as much ſubject to the proceſs of the</hi> Law, as any private <hi>Citizen;</hi> That, the <hi>queſtion</hi> they were to try was, <hi>Whether</hi> Mr Papillon <hi>had probable Cauſe of Action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Mayor;</hi> That the <hi>Caſe</hi> was thus, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the conteſt about the choice of</hi> Sheriffs, <hi>the</hi> Judges <hi>of the</hi> Election, <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie to the</hi> Mayor <hi>and</hi> Aldermen, <hi>that Mr</hi> Papillon <hi>had moſt Suffrages; thereupon he conceived himſelf rightly choſen;</hi> and that ſurely, gave him a <hi>probable cauſe</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon it; and if ſo, no doubt he might well take the courſe he did; <hi>here is no Arreſt without legal Proceſs;</hi> nay, their own
<hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſay, there was an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to take an
<hi>appearance,</hi> without an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;</hi> but, that being refuſed,
<hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:59848:122"/>
               <hi>of the Law was executed</hi>—He had no other courſe to take, but to bring his Action againſt the <hi>Mayor;</hi> This courſe he took; <hi>here is a great deal of ſtir made</hi> that a <hi>Coroner</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> ſhould Arreſt my <hi>Lord Mayor; he might do it lawfully;</hi> doth this prove, that this was <hi>malitiouſly</hi> done? Have they proved any particular diſcontent and <hi>malice,</hi> that was between them? No, the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears; <hi>did he Violently Arreſt him? That he might do,</hi> and no offence in Law; no, but he did it not, but only deſired from time to time, that he would give an <hi>appearence,</hi> that would have put a Concluſion to this diſpute—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> having made a return of Mr <hi>Papillon's</hi> Election to the <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> they being of another opinion, <hi>gave order that thoſe who thought themſelves agrieved, ſhould take their remedy at Law;</hi> which has been purſued, in the regular courſe, the Law preſcribes—Here is a great noiſe of <hi>Damage</hi> and <hi>Diſrepute</hi> and <hi>Diſgrace;</hi> and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> has been pleaſed to reckon his own
<hi>Damages</hi> at 10000 l.—We ſay, he has ſuſtained no Damage—<hi>The very Court of</hi> Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>and the</hi> Lord Mayor,
<hi>bidding them</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:59848:122"/>
               <hi>take their courſe at Law;</hi> We, ſure, ſhall not be puniſhed for doing it.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Williams</hi> then inſiſted, that the
<hi>Plaintiff's</hi> Action muſt fall, if they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was not Malitious, and that Mr <hi>Papillon had a probable cauſe to bring his Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Ward</hi> then obſerved to the <hi>Jury,</hi> that Mr
<hi>Papillon</hi> had been greatly reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon; That by way of
<hi>Crimination</hi> againſt him, there was a moſt unjuſt reflection, as if he were privy to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Inſurrection</hi> and
<hi>Conſpiracy</hi> againſt the <hi>King's</hi> Life; and procured the
<hi>Mayor</hi> to be Arreſted, to promote an <hi>Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi> That this was only inſinuated for <hi>Reflection</hi> ſake, and not one word of any ſuch thing proved; He then added, that the Caſe before them depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point; <hi>Whether Mr</hi> Papillon <hi>had a reaſonable cauſe or probable ground to bring an Action againſt Sr</hi> William Pritchard; If ſo, all that was deſired, was only an <hi>Appearance,</hi> but that would not be given.—That the <hi>Jury</hi> had been told, of the great dangers in the Caſe, as to the Infringment of the <hi>Peace, &amp;c.</hi> but had Sr
<hi>William Pritchard</hi> complyed, with the reaſonable and oft repeated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59848:123"/>of ordering an <hi>Appearence,</hi> the
<hi>Peace of the</hi> Kingdom <hi>had been in no peril from ſuch a deſign as this Arreſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> told Mr <hi>Ward,</hi> (<hi>a Perſon never eſteemed to come ſhort of</hi> Sr George Jefferies, <hi>in any thing but Inſolence and Impudence</hi>) That he had made a long Speech, and nothing at all to the purpoſe; and <hi>that he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he was about;</hi> and that made him ramble in his Diſcourſe; and did then, in a raving and moſt impetuous manner, repeat his expreſſion ſix or ſeven times, that Mr <hi>Ward</hi> did not underſtand the Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Brome</hi> the <hi>Coroner</hi> (being called to give an account of the manner of his Arreſting my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi>) teſtified; That he had a former Writ in <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> and went to my <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> and deſired him that he would appear to it, but he ſaid, <hi>he would give no Appearance;</hi> That he gave his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> a week or ten days to conſider of it; and then waited upon him at the <hi>Court of Aldermen,</hi> and had his anſwer, <hi>that he had conſidered of it, and would give no appearance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That, a little before <hi>Eaſter Term,</hi> the
<hi>Attorney</hi> brought him another <hi>VVrit,</hi> and<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59848:123"/>threatned to complain to the Court of him, for neglecting the Execution of two of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>VVrits;</hi> That thereupon he went again to my <hi>Lord,</hi> and told him that the <hi>VVrit</hi> was renewed, and he was preſſed to make a return; and deſired, that his
<hi>Lordſhip</hi> would pleaſe to give an Appearance; and that he told him that <hi>he</hi> was ready to ſubmit to the <hi>King's Writ, but would not give an Appearance;</hi> and thereupon the <hi>Officers</hi> named in the Warrant, Arreſted him by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>Then, Mr <hi>Criſp the common Serjeant,</hi> (aiming at
<hi>Alderman Corniſh</hi>) falls to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogating <hi>Mr Brome,</hi> who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the meeting, when the Arreſting the <hi>Mayor</hi> was agreed upon; he having named two or three, the <hi>Common Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> further preſſed him to name others; and then, the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> explained the <hi>Common Serjeant's</hi> meaning, by demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether <hi>Mr Corniſh</hi> was there?</p>

<hi>Whining Fellows?</hi>—Do you think to ſham <hi>People</hi> into
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59848:124"/>Offices? No, <hi>I tell you, Villany was the Foundation of it,</hi> and Knavery <hi>the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure—Neither</hi> Bethel,

            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Gilbert Nelſon</hi> then teſtified, That upon the holdling up of the Hands, at the <hi>Election</hi> of <hi>Sheriffs</hi> the
24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1682. there were upon the view, moſt for
<hi>Mr Papillon</hi> and <hi>Mr Dubois;</hi> and that upon the caſting up the
<hi>Poll Books,</hi> there was the greateſt number for <hi>Mr Papillon. Mr Wightman</hi> added, that in the <hi>Poll-Books,</hi> there were 2400. and odd, for <hi>Mr Papillon</hi> and <hi>Mr Dubois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Leonard Robinſon</hi> added, that by the Hands, the majority was much more for <hi>Mr P.</hi> and <hi>Mr D.</hi> than for the other two; and the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> did ſo declare their opinion; and a
<hi>Poll</hi> being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and granted, after it was cloſed in the Evening; the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> declared the Numbers upon the <hi>Huſtings; Mr P.</hi> and <hi>Mr D.</hi> had above two thouſand, and <hi>Mr North</hi> and
<hi>Mr Box</hi> ſome hundreds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two thouſand.</p>

               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:59848:125"/>Mr <hi>Baker</hi> teſtified, that the Action was brought by the advice of Mr <hi>Wallop,</hi> Mr <hi>Pollexfen</hi> and Mr <hi>Thompſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> comes to ſum up the Evidence, and after a moſt tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Introduction proceeds to diſcharge his Spleene thus; Come, <hi>Gentlemen, it is beſt to be plain;</hi> Tho' it is true, a Man may lawfully ſue for ſuch an Office, and it is no offence, yet it looks ſomewhat extraordinary, 'tis for ſome ſtrange purpoſe or other—It is notoriouſly known, <hi>that for ſeveral Years the</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<hi>has been beſet,</hi> and, which is a baſer thing than ever was thought of, or acted in the higheſt times of <hi>Villany; the very Methods of</hi> Juſtice <hi>have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;</hi> and all to ſerve the main deſign of ſubverting the <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> this is ſo black a Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that no honeſt Man, that has any ſenſe of <hi>Loyalty, Religion, or common Juſtice;</hi> but muſt tremble at the very thoughts of it: <hi>When we ſee ſuch</hi> Fellows <hi>as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reproaches to the</hi> Government;
<hi>ſhall get into Office, to make</hi> Ignoramus Juryes—When men begin to take Oathes to ſanctifie Villany, what ſhall we ſay? And all this you, all of you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> know<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59848:125"/>to be true—Was it not more ſafe to conſpire the death of the <hi>King</hi> &amp; his
<hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> than to give the leaſt frown upon one of theſe
<hi>ſnivelling Saints?</hi> Did not we know, that Men were ſanctified to be
<hi>Jury-men,</hi> that before, were never thought fit to be truſted, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Society of honeſt Men?</p>
            <p>Mr Papillon <hi>knows all this to be true emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently:</hi> When pack'd Jurys were grown to that heighth, that when ſeven or eight
<hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſwore down-right <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> The
<hi>Traytor</hi> could not by theſe Men ſo much as be accuſed by an
<hi>Indictment;</hi> To that ſtupidity in Villany, were things brought by theſe <hi>Fellows;</hi> So far were the proceedings in <hi>Courts</hi> of
<hi>Juſtice</hi> tainted, that <hi>cropp'd Hair and a demure Look, were the beſt ſigns of a good Evidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> There was not a purſuit of right in this caſe, <hi>It was a deſigned piece of Villany, on purpoſe to affront the</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>nay, to deſtroy it;</hi> and if he were ten thouſand times Mr <hi>Papillon,</hi> I would tell him ſo.</p>
            <p>It is plain, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, from the beginning to the end, was to cauſe a tumult and confuſion in the
<hi>City;</hi> in order to put that damned <hi>helliſh</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:59848:126"/>
               <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> for deſtroying the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Brother,</hi> and every man, that was <hi>honeſt</hi> and

<hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We all know Mr <hi>Papillon</hi> to be a wealthy Man; one that had rather have minded his Affairs, than the expenſive Office of
<hi>Sheriff;</hi> but, <hi>that ſomething was to be done, to wreak a damned Malice and Revenge upon the</hi> Government—This I tell him openly, and let him and his party make their Remarks upon it as they pleaſe—There was queſtionleſs, a deviliſh Malice, fixed in his heart and mind; and he wanted an opportunity to effect it, and he thought it beſt for his own ſecurity, to take this courſe, and nothing elſe was in it.—Alack-a-day (as <hi>Mr Pilkington</hi> ſaid) <hi>I am for the preſervation of the</hi> Liberties <hi>and</hi> Properties <hi>of the</hi> Subject; but I find the <hi>City</hi> is ſtrangely run down, in their Rights and Priviledges, I will rather take a troubleſome Office, than let all run thus, and immediately ſets himſelf a <hi>Cock-a-hoop,</hi> as if there were none to take care of the <hi>City,</hi> but himſelf—He, and Mr
<hi>Bethel</hi> and Mr <hi>Corniſh</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, are the only Men of the times,<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59848:126"/>the Men; <hi>Men for the Liberties of the</hi> Subject, <hi>and the Rights of the</hi> City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen, the Government is infinitely concerned in this Caſe;</hi> that puts a weight upon your enquiry into the damages; <hi>your ſeverity in this Caſe, will deter all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from entring into Clans and Cabals to affront the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may not further nauſeat the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> with the foul Language &amp; venomous Malice of this <hi>Inſolent, arrogant</hi> and
<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Slanderer,</hi> I ſhall tranſcribe no more of his virulent diſcourſe, though he run on to a ſtrange length, at a moſt wicked and infamous rate of Falſhoods and Defamations, againſt the beſt Men of the

            <p>WHen the Reader remembers what part this Eminent and Worthy

<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and <hi>Popery; Engliſh Liberties</hi> and
<hi>Tyranny;</hi> he will not be ſurpriſed to ſee him overwheml'd; when by the Aid of the worſt of men; the Banks of our Security were broken down, and the Torrent of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> carried all before it.</p>
            <p>That from the time of the diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> the <hi>Conſpirators,</hi> did, with indefatigable Induſtry, apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſhift it off to the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> is moſt undoubtedly and beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction true.

<hi>Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> againſt <hi>Arbitrary Attempts</hi> upon them; <hi>Lay in Tryals by Juryes;</hi> The

<hi>Popiſh</hi> deſign, <hi>of murdering</hi> Proteſtants <hi>under colour of</hi> Law, <pb n="247" facs="tcp:59848:128"/>
               <hi>was Poſt-poned;</hi> until the Ancient Right of Electing <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> was raviſh'd from the
<hi>City</hi> in the year 1682.</p>
            <p>However, the <hi>Conſpirators,</hi> impatient of delay, made their attempt in the <hi>Sheriff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> of Mr <hi>Bethel</hi> &amp; Mr
<hi>Corniſh;</hi> The Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and divers others are now clapt up, upon pretence of a <hi>Plot;</hi> and an experiment is made upon Mr
<hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> a Man of great Honeſty and who wanted nothing but a Figure to make him every way valuable; But theſe <hi>Sheriffs</hi> not furniſhing a Jury to cut him off; The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and the reſt who were impriſoned, are reſerved for the next
<hi>Sheriffalty;</hi> When they hoped (<hi>tho' as Heaven would have it, without ground</hi>) to get <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and by them <hi>Juryes,</hi> for their purpoſe<hi>:</hi> And the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> being enraged at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment and baffle put upon them by an honeſt <hi>City-Jury,</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Mr Colledge,</hi> They hurry that poor man to
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and there, by moſt unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidented illegal Practices,
<hi>baſely murder him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, it cannot be forgotten, that the honeſt endeavour of theſe worthy <hi>Sheriffs</hi> (Mr <hi>Bethel</hi> and Mr
<hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>)<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59848:129"/>to have the <hi>Sham-Plot</hi> of

            <p>The mentioning this <hi>Wretch,</hi> forces a Remembrance of the Stratagems then uſed, to preſent his diſcovery of the Authors of his

            </p>
            <p>Hereupon Mr <hi>Corniſh</hi> ſaid, that he was as Innocent as any Man in the <hi>Court,</hi> and the <hi>Attorney</hi> ironically replyed; So was my <hi>Lord Ruſſel</hi> to his Death, Mr <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh;</hi> do you remember that?</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Colonel Romſey</hi> (<hi>who to the certain knowledge of the</hi> Judges and King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>had perjured himſelf in the Tryal of my</hi> Lord Ruſſel) teſtified, that about <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> or
<hi>November,</hi> 1682. he went to Mr <hi>Shepherd's</hi> Houſe, to the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Lord
<hi>Gray,</hi> Sr <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> and Mr <hi>Ferguſon;</hi> That they were juſt going away when he came; That before they went, <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Corniſh</hi> was brought in by <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and made his Excuſe that he did not come ſooner, and ſaid he could not ſtay with them: That thereupon Mr <hi>Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> opened his Boſome, and pull'd out a
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59848:132"/>Paper, and read it to him, Mr <hi>Shepherd holding the Candle;</hi> and after it was read he ſaid he liked it well; That he the ſaid <hi>Romſey,</hi> did not hear all the the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per read, but it was a
<hi>Declaration</hi> to have been diſperſed when the <hi>Riſing</hi> was to have been.</p>
            <p>That there were, as he well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, two points in it, One was
<hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and the other, That all, who would aſſiſt in the <hi>Inſurrection,</hi> that had any Lands of the
<hi>King's</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> in the late War, ſhould have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Goodenough,</hi> (<hi>who to capacitate him to be a Witneſs, brought a Pardon for one</hi> Treaſon, <hi>for which he had been</hi> Outlawed, <hi>and ſtood awed with the guilt of another</hi>) He teſtified, that being with <hi>Alderman Corniſh</hi> in the beginning of the year, 1683. He ſaid to him, Now the Law won't defend us, tho' we be never ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſome other way is to be thought on and that upon this, the
<hi>Alderman</hi> ſaid, he wondered the <hi>City</hi> was ſo unready, and the <hi>Country</hi> ſo ready; That he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon told him, that ſomething was thought of to be done here, but in the firſt place the <hi>Tower</hi> ought to be ſeized;<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59848:133"/>That the <hi>Alderman,</hi> after a little pauſe, ſaid, <hi>I will do what I can, or what good I can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſome time after, the <hi>Alderman</hi> met him upon the
<hi>Exchange;</hi> and asked him how Affairs went; <hi>which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to relatc to what they had diſcourſed;</hi> and that he anſwered him,
<hi>Well; But he acknowledged that he had other matters with him, about the defence of the</hi> Riot.</p>
            <p>Upon this mention of the <hi>Riot, Juſtice Wythens</hi> reflected, ſaying, Mr. <hi>Corniſh, I tell you that was a branch of the</hi> Plot, take that from me; and quickly after he told him ſomething as true, (<hi>viz</hi>) Mr <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> you have this
<hi>Happineſs,</hi> that you will be Tryed by your <hi>Fellow Citizens,</hi> of very good Quality and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I muſt tell you.</hi>

            <p>On behalf of <hi>Alderman Corniſh,</hi> there appeared Sr

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Sheriff;</hi> but the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſlighted their Evidence; and
<hi>Wythens,</hi> ſaid Mr <hi>Jekyl was in a Limb of the</hi> Plot,

               <hi>one of the greateſt of the</hi> Rioters.

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Then Sr <hi>Thomas Lane</hi> teſtified, that in my <hi>Lord Ruſſel</hi>'s Tryal, <hi>Romſey</hi> ſwore <hi>that he did not hear the Declaration read, it being done before he came.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr <hi>Calamy</hi> Mr <hi>Carlton</hi> Mr <hi>Cooke</hi> Mr
<hi>Knap</hi> and Mr <hi>Smart,</hi> then ſpoke to the Life, Reputation and
<hi>Loyalty</hi> of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It deſerves to be noted, that after the Evidence given, Mr
<hi>Solicitor</hi> did here omit the drudgery (<hi>which in all other Caſes of this nature he underwent</hi>) by a long florid Speech, to impreſs the
<hi>Jury</hi> in the matter<hi>:</hi> here it ſufficed that <hi>Judge Wythens</hi> had juſt before paſſed his word, that this <hi>Jury was compoſed of</hi> Citizens <hi>of very good quality and underſtanding;</hi> therefore they might be truſted, well enough; knowing what they had to do.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice Jones,</hi> who had in the whole proceeding of the Tryal, diſcovered ſufficient tartneſs; ſumed up the Evidence to the Jury. Then,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jury</hi> being withdrawn, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner informed the
<hi>Court,</hi> that he had omitted to call one material Witneſs,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59848:134"/>whereupon the <hi>Jury</hi> being returned,</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Shepherd</hi> teſtified, That Mr <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh came into his Houſe to ſpeak with the</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi> Monmouth, or ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he could not poſitively, after ſo many Years, ſay whom;
<hi>and did not ſtay half a quarter of an Hour;</hi> That <hi>Shepherd went up Staires, and came out of the Room with him; and that there was not one Word read, or Paper ſeen while Mr</hi> Corniſh <hi>was there; That he was not look'd upon to be one of the</hi> Company; <hi>But before he came,</hi> Mr Ferguſon <hi>had pull'd off his Shooe, and took the Declaration out there, and read it;</hi> and Mr <hi>Corniſh</hi> knew nothing of it.</p>
            <p>[Note, <hi>This evidence to a tittle ſtands with what</hi> Romſey <hi>ſwore at my</hi> Lord Ruſſel's <hi>Tryal, which was, that about the latter end of</hi> October, <hi>or the beginning of</hi> November,
<hi>my Lord of</hi> Shaftesbury <hi>told him of the meeting of the Duke,</hi> Lord Ruſſell, Lord Grey, Sr Thomas Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong, <hi>and</hi> Mr Ferguſon
<hi>at</hi> Shepherd's <hi>and ſent him to them; which evinces that Mr</hi> Corniſh <hi>was not lookt upon, to be one of the</hi> Company, <hi>for if he had, the Earl of</hi> Shaftesbury <hi>would undoubtedly have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him alſo:</hi> Romſey <hi>then alſo ſwore po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuively that he was not there above a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:59848:134"/>
               <hi>of an hour, and that he was not at the reading of the</hi> Declaration, <hi>for it was done before he came.</hi>]</p>
            <p>However, the <hi>Solicitor General,</hi> and alſo the
<hi>Recorder</hi> affirmed this evidence of <hi>Mr Shepherd's</hi> had cleared the matter againſt the <hi>Priſoner, which before ſeemed dark;</hi> if ſo, what need now (<hi>the</hi> Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor <hi>having before left it without any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the</hi> Jury) of varniſhing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? But 'tis evident, they were now pinch'd, and therefore Mr <hi>Solicitor's Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick</hi> was found requiſit to ſecure a <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi> and he thus uttered it;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen, there has been a very great Indulgence given to the Priſoner;</hi> After a full evidence, you were again ſent for, to hear what he had to offer to you; I cannot but obſerve, this looks like a ſubtile contrivance on the <hi>Priſoner's</hi> part; when you are with-drawn,
<hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi> ſends intelligence to him, that he had ſomething to ſay, that might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him; Truely I am very glad Mr <hi>Shepherd</hi> has been here, <hi>he is ſo far from in validating any part of the</hi> Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>that</hi> by all the Circumſtances you can collect from this Evidence, <hi>it is a Corroboration of it:</hi> It hereby appears that
<hi>Mr Corniſh</hi> was in that Company,<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59848:135"/>and came when they were met in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate—No Man almoſt but muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he was privy to the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; therefore, tho' this Witneſs ſeems to forget ſome part of the Evidence, the reading the <hi>Declaration,</hi> and holding the Candle; yet theſe are ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that in themſelves do carry a proof of the Charge, and do confirm (<hi>He ſhould have ſaid contradict</hi>) all the reſt that <hi>Colonel Romſey</hi> hath ſaid;
<hi>and this muſt be a great ſatisfaction to you, that he was there preſent and privy to that Deſign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Jury</hi> with-drew for a ſhort time, and returning, brought the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner</hi> in <hi>Guilty.</hi> Thereupon the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Corniſh,</hi> your Crime is for <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> committed in the time of his late <hi>Majeſty;</hi> being one of thoſe
